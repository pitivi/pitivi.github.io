I started by\nexamining the patch supplied by Richard Boulton almost a year ago, which\nimplemented the complete application logic for handling saving and\nloading of projects. The patch does not, however, implement reading and\nwriting of the project file itself. The patch no longer cleanly applies,\nso I did my best to apply it manually. I then created a new patch, which\nI've uploaded to bugzilla. It's still only a partial patch, and it\nbreaks parts of the UI. My goal for the next day or so is to extract the\nbest parts of his design, and then implement my own solution. I'll\nprobably use some of his code in the system, but will definitely be\nre-implementing the UI.\nPart of the work on implementing file load/save support is creating a\ndesign document. Edward suggested that I put all my Design\nDocs up on the Wiki.\n"});
