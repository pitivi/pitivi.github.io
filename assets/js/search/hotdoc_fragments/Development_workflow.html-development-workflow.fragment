Most of the time, you announce you are\nworking on an issue, work on it until it's fixed, and then the issue is\nclosed automatically when a commit with \"Fixes #issue_number\" is merged.\nInterested users can enable notifications for an existing issue to\nget an email when it's updated. It's also possible to change your\n\"Notification settings\" for\npitivi from the default\n\"Global\" to \"Watch\", to receive notifications for any activity in the\nentire project.\n"});
