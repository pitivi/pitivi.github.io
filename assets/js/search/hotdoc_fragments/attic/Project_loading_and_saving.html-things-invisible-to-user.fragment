Consequently, implicit in\nthe New, Save, and Save As commands is the “Close Project” command.\nSince PiTiVi's UI must always display a project, a “Close Project”\ncommand would be identical to the “New Project” command. Based on this,\nit makes sense to omit “Close Project” from the UI. Nevertheless, it\nshould still be considered a command that is part of this module, for\nthe sake of code reuse.\n"});
