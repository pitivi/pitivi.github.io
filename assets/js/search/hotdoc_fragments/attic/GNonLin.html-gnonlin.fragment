The goals of the GNonLin elements are:\nInitially created to be used in video editors, GNonLin was also made\ngeneric so it can be used for audio editors, jukebox applications,\nslideshows, live editing, etc.\nWhile GNonLin was historically used as the sole editing backend for\nPitivi, Jokosher and other applications, it is not recommended to\nuse GNonLin directly anymore, unless you have a special appetite for\nunwarranted pain and a Ph.D. in nuclear physics. Instead, you should use\nGES.\n\nTo be GStreamer elements, and therefore integrating themselves\nperfectly into any GStreamer pipeline,\nTo not use any specific API, except for the GStreamer/GObject\nAPI, making them easy to use with any language already supporting\nthe GStreamer API,\nTo provide somewhat of an “editing point-of-view” to using gstreamer\n(sources, effects, position in time, ...),\nTo be non-destructive.\n\n"});
