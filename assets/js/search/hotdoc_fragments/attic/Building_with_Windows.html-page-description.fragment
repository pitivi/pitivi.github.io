I recommend Sublime or\nNotepad++.\nSadly I do not know how to make a .bat available in the task bar / dock,\nso make a link on the Desktop.\nThis needs to be configured to be able to use the package manager\nmingw-get.\n$ mingw-get install mintty\nNow we need to set it as the default shell\nAdd following line to C:\\MinGW\\msys\\1.0\\mys.bat after line 58:\nset MSYSCON=mintty.exe\nIt its scaled dynamically. You can copy with just selecting text. You\ncan paste with middle click. Cool.\nWe will need to add everything to our path manually.\nAdd the following lines at the end of C:\\MinGW\\msys\\1.0\\etc\\profile\nexport PATH=$PATH:/c/Python27\nexport PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\\ Files\\$x86$/Git/bin\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/bmonkey/cerbero/\nexport PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\\ Files\\$x86$/CMake/bin\nalias cerbero=cerbero-uninstalled\nNote that the cerbero path is the path where we will clone cerbero into\nin the next step. You need to change it to your user name.\nSave the file and restart your shell.\nThe bootstrap will fail if git config is not set up. Do the following:\n$ git config --global user.email“you@example.com”\n$ git config --global user.name“Your`` ``Name”\n$ git clonegit://anongit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/cerbero\nNow we need to get some extra dependencies from mingw-get to start the\nbootstrap.\n$ mingw-get.exe install msys-perl msys-patch msys-bison msys-flex msys-coreutils\nNow we can start cerbero bootstrap.\nIf you cannot access the cerbero command, make sure its in the PATH in\nyour bash profile.\n$ cerbero bootstrap\nGo get some coffee.\n$ cerbero build gst-editing-services-1.0\nGo plant a tree. This can take hours.\nSince GES does not depend on all plugins, you need to build them\nmanually.\n$ cerbero build gst-plugins-bad-1.0\n$ cerbero build gst-plugins-ugly-1.0\n$ cerbero build gst-libav-1.0\nYou probably want to use ges-launch-1.0.exe and friends in the shell. To\ndo this, add the dist folder to the PATH.\nIn your bash profle:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/bmonkey/cerbero/dist/windows_x86_64/bin/\nIf you encounter the configure process to freeze, you need to close the\nshell and kill all sh.exe processes in the task manager. Alternatively\nyou can log out and log in.\nchecking for msgfmt... /c/Users/Lubosz/cerbero/build-tools/bin/msgfmt\nchecking for gmsgfmt... /c/Users/Lubosz/cerbero/build-tools/bin/msgfmt\nchecking for xgettext... /c/Users/Lubosz/cerbero/build-tools/bin/xgettext\nchecking for msgmerge...\n\nBash only is fine\nIMPORTANT: Select the install option “Checkout as-is, Commit as-is”\n\n\nChoose the MSI Installer for x86_64.\nFor all users\nTo C:\\Python27\\\n\n\nTo C:\\MinGW\nSelect the following packages in “Basic Setup”:\n\nmingw32-base\nmingw32-gcc-g++\nmsys-base\n\n\nInstallation => Apply changes\nClose the dialoge when complete\n\n\nmingw32-base\nmingw32-gcc-g++\nmsys-base\n\n\nMake a link on your Desktop to C:\\MinGW\\msys\\1.0\\msys.bat\nRename it to msys Shell and give it a nice icon.\n\n\nGo to C:\\MinGW\\msys\\1.0\\etc\\\nrename fastab.sample to fstab. If you installed MinGW to another\nfolder, you need to edit this file.\n\n\nOpen the shell from your Desktop.\nIt is a cmd like shell. Pasting sucks. We should install a cooler\none with transparency and stuff.\n\n\nOpen your new cool shell mintty.\n\n"});
