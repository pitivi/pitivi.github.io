fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Plugins.html#page-description","fragment":"Pitivi's Plugin Manager is based on libpeas. Currently we only support plugins written in Python 3.\nThere are two directories where Pitivi is looking for plugins. One is the system plugins directory, where normally you'll find the plugins we ship by default. The other is the user plugins directory, where you can hack your own plugin.\nDepending on how you installed Pitivi, these directories can have different locations. In the Plugins tab in the Preferences window you should be able to find out the location of the two directories.\nEach plugin must have its own directory, so start with creating a directory, for example hello.\nTo provide some info about the plugin, create a plugin info file, for example hello/world.plugin:\nThe \"Loader=python3\" and \"Module=world\" above specify the plugin is loaded from the hello/world.py Python module. The module should contain at least one class implementing the Peas.Activatable interface:\nStart Pitivi, activate the plugin in Preferences > Plugins, and notice \"Hello World!\" in the console.\n\nThere is no API really. Plugins have full access to the entire app. Needless to\nsay, they will break sooner or later, as we refactor parts of the app. Use them\nto have fun and try things out. If you think more people would be interested in\nthem, talk with us to see what we can do to\nhelp them survive.\nThe entire Pitivi instance is provided through self.object.app in the do_activate method:\nFor an advanced example, check out how to create a plugin for automating the operations with the clips in the timeline.\n"});
