While\nI was at it I created a helper widget to display the start and end\npoints of each clip above the slider. I also made it so that the start\nand stop trim buttons gray out when you drag the slider past the start\nor stop of the clip. This prevents you from setting the end before the\nstart, or vice versa. Meanwhile, Edward Hervey has tracked down the\nsource of a bug that caused PiTiVi to crash when dragging new sources\ninto the timeline.\n"});
