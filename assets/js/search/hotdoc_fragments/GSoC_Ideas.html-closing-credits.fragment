As GstWPE is a live source it\ndoes not allow seeking (getting frames at random positions), we have to add\nlogic in Pitivi for seamlessly creating a video file out of an animated HTML\npage. The resulting file can be used in the project timeline as any other video\nclip. You'd have to extend the UI with a new\nperspective\nfor managing the closing credits HTML, and the corresponding video files.\nRequirements: Python. Minimal experience contributing to Pitivi including\nunit tests.\n"});
