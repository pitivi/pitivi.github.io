(Paulius Šukys,\n2014-03-03)\n“Great little application for quick video editing”:\nIf you want to do some quick and simple video editing and exporting\nthen this is a great app for that. Do not expect it to do the world.\n(Iain Lane, 2011-11-02)\n“Must Have Video Editor!”:\nGotta be one of the best I've used! It's definitely gotten WORLDS\nbetter than it used to be. (Yanike, 2011-12-14)\n“My Favorite Video Editor on Ubuntu”:\nI know that OpenShot seems to get a lot more attention as a video\neditor on Ubuntu, but I find Pitivi to be the better software. For\nexample, I find making the actual cuts, more instinctual on Pitivi,\nand I'm able to be more precise - It earns a lot of points for that.\n[...] if you really want to do some efficient editing, I say go\nwith Pitivi. It gets my vote. (DigitalMan, 2011-11-27)\n“Better than Ever”:\nWhat else can I say? UI is good, effects are nice and it handles big\nfiles (2 GB) without crashing. It took a while, but now Pitivi is\nfinally usable editor with potential! (PYHhfWp, 2011-10-31)\n“Getting there”:\nIt has taken a while, but as of version 0.15.0, Pitivi is both\nstable for me and presents a sufficient featureset to be useful.\nCompared to other video editors, I find the UI a pleasure to use.\nHowever, it's about time the still missing features (titling and\nmore complex transitions) are implemented.
