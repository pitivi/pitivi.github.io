fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"GSoC_Ideas.html#external-audio-editing-integration","fragment":"External audio editing integration\nThe audio editing features in Pitivi are likely to stay at a basic level so we\ncan focus on the video editing functionality. Once a video segment is finished,\nit would be great to be able to export the entire audio and work on it with an\naudio editor such as Audacity. See for example\nhow the experimental Blender-Audacity integration\nworks and its\nPython implementation.\nRequirements: Python. Minimal experience contributing to Pitivi including\nunit tests. Experience developing GTK apps is a plus.\n"});
