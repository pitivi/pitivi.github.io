If you're not sure\nwhere you can be most useful, have a look at our list of ideas below. These\nshall be used as a base for writing a detailed project proposal.\nSee Past GSoCs for details on what the previous GSoC students did.\nTo create a detailed proposal, use our GSoC application template.\nDeadlines for applying are approaching fast, hurry up!\n\n\nPitivi, which is the user interface.
