When a\nproxy file does not exist for an asset (clip), create it and use it as\nsoon as it has been created.\nPerformance requirements in the automated scenario are even more\nimportant than in the semi-automated scenario; while users can expect\nsome delay (as long as there is a visual progress indication) when they\nmanually trigger an action, they must absolutely not feel\ndelays/sluggishness when such actions are triggered automatically. The\ngeneration of proxy clips in the background should not negatively impact\nsystem performance.\nJakub has a different opinion than Jeff's or Bassam's, suggesting (?)\nthat we make proxy generation a modal (blocking, in terms of UI)\noperation:\n\"You mention the problem of indicating the transcoding process as if\nyou could continue working with original assets and have that not stop\nyou from editing work with original media. In case of offline editing\n(either having assets on external drive, or networked/cloud storage),\nthe indication can be summed up to “tell me when my assets are safe to\ndisconnect and I'm able to proceed editing offline”. For low\nperforming systems, the background transcoding is just an illusion,\nyou cannot really edit until your assets are transcoded. So I think\nboth cases are best addressed by providing an aggregate progressbar\ntelling me when all assets referenced from the project are transcoded,\nrather than colorcoding individual clips, or worrying about preview\noverlays. [...] For offline editing I would agree not choking the\nsystem competely with transcoding might be a good thing, but for the\nlow performing system case you want the transcoding process to take\nthe foreground so that the assets are ready sooner. You really can't\ndo any 4k editing on a laptop and expect to also transcode proxies in\nthe background.\"\n"});
