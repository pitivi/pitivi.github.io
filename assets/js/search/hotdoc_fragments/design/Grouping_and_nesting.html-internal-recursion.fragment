fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"design/Grouping_and_nesting.html#internal-recursion","fragment":"Internal Recursion\nTo provide more advanced functionality, we will require recursion that\nis not opaque to the Pitivi user interface. In Pitivi, source clips are\nimmutable, and this invariant seems worth preserving for the sake of\npredictable behavior. Therefore, if groups are to be editable (and\ndistinct from ordinary clips), they should not be implemented via the\nstandard clip mechanism as described above.\nTo allow the user interface to behave differently for groups than for\nindividual clips, while still preserving a simple recursive structure,\none solution is to have entire Pitivi sub-projects defined within a\nsingle project file, and inserted into the timeline as a\ntimeline-object. Then the “group” action generates a subproject\nequivalent to the selected items, deletes those items from the timeline,\nand adds the subproject-object to the timeline in their place. “Ungroup”\ndoes the reverse.\n"});
