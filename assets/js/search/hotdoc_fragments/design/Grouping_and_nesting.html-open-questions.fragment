(I\nthink that it should be possible to apply such effects and arbitrary\noperations to a group, and that Ungroup should simply be disabled until\nall modifications to the group are removed.)\nShould groups be displayed in the superproject with “holes” in time\nwhere there is an empty time in the subproject timeline, or should they\nsimply be continuous? Should there be a mode where even more of the\ninternal structure is visible? (I think that, for a first\nimplementation, leaving them as continuous in the superproject UI is\nentirely sufficient and dramatically simpler to implement than the\nalternatives.)\nIs the duration of a group fixed or variable? If it is fixed, then we\nwill need some UI to indicate a timeline of fixed duration (in the\nsubproject editor). If it is variable, then what happens when the user\nuses the subproject editor to make the contents of the group longer?\nShould it expand in the super-project, or should excess time be ignored.\n(I think excess time should be ignored, with duration controlled\nexclusively from the super-project. Ideally, it should be possible to\nmodify duration (and start-point) non-destructively from the\nsuper-project, and the subproject editor UI should indicate which\nportions of its timeline are actually in use in the super-project.)\nShould it be possible to copy a group by reference or only by value?\ni.e. can there exist multiple objects in a timeline that refer to the\nsame subproject? (I think copy-by-reference is too valuable to give up,\nbut careful UI design will be required to avoid creating massive\nconfusion. A unique name for each subproject, displayed in every\nsuperproject timeline-object that references it, might help.)\n"});
