fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"design/UI_Implementation.html#views","fragment":"Views\nView objects appear exclusively in the time-line component of the UI.\nEach view represents some object in the current timeline. Views must\nupdate their appearance when the object they represent changes. While in\nmost cases, this will be accomplished by connecting to model signals, it\nis up to the individual view object to do this. No infrastructure is\nprovided by the View base class. In general, views should multiply from\nView and some subclass of goocanvas.Item. The controller code connects\nto specific signals, and expects that these signals will have the same\nsignature as defined in goocanvas.Item.\nViews provide a public interface for controlling appearance. There are 3\nindependent visual states:\nA fourth state, normal, is defined as being simultaneously unfocused,\ninactive, and deselected.\n\nfocused/unfocused\nactive/inactive\nselected/deselected.\n\n"});
