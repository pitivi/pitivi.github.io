Core objects emit\nsignals which prompt changes in the UI. UI elements wrap core objects to\nmanipulate data, which in turn emit signals. The observer pattern allows\nthe user interface to listen for changes in the core without coupling\nthe core to the UI.\nIn core, we have our own pure-python implementation of “signals”. The\nuser interface depends on pygtk and pygoocanvas, both of which are based\non GObject. We use “receivers” to automatically connect appropriate\nsignal handler methods to objects which emit them.\n"});
