It is a simple, fast and elegant programming language.\nIt allows faster, agile and robust software development.\nSome people wrongly assume that Python applications are automatically\nslow and bloated. This is untrue for many reasons:\nMost of what I highlighted above can also be found in Python's page on\nspeed and performance\ntips.\n\nPython is actually surprisingly fast in many cases.\nPython is not the performance bottleneck here. Seriously.\nGStreamer and GES are the components doing the\nheavy work, and they are written in C. Pitivi is basically just a\npretty user interface on top of those.\nMost performance issues on desktop apps are not micro-optimization\nproblems, but I/O bound operations or “stupid algorithms/methods\nthat do unnecessary work”. Federico Mena Quintero did a great\npresentation\n(video,\nslides)\nalong those lines a couple of years ago.\n\n"});
