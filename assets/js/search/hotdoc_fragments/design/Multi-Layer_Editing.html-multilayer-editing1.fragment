The higher the source, the higher the priority. The lower the\nsource, the lower the priority. The object with the highest priority is\nthe output for the track. This object will frequently be a source, but\nit may also be an effect. So, for example, two sources can be mixed\ntogether with a superimpose effect.\nThe user can change the priority of an object by moving it up or down. A\nnew visual layer will be created if necessary.\n"});
