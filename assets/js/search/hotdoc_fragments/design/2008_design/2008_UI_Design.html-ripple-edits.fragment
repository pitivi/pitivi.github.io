The source who's trimming\nhandle is being manipulated is trimmed as usual, however the adjacent\nsource(s) are rightward in the appropriate direction, so that the\ntrimming does not create a gap between the sources. This shifting\ncarries down the entire length of the track, keeping sources in the same\nrelative position.\n\nUser places cursor over the desired source's trimming handle.\n\nUser holds the appropriate modifier key. Cursor changes to ripple cursor\n\nUser drags the the mouse. Adjacent sources are shifted.\n\nThe user can also hold an additional modifier key to make the ripple\nedit work across multiple layers.\nIf the user releases the ripple-edit modifier key, the edit reverts to\nthe default trimming operation.\n"});
