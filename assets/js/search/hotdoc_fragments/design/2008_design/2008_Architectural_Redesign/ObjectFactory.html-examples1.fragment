We\ncould link all those separate A/V content into one source, allowing\nfixing of synchronization, and then be usable as one item in a\ntimeline.\n\n\nLocalSourceDevicesFactory : SourceDeviceFactory aggregating all\navailable LocalSourceDevice on the current system. We can then\neasily switch between the various devices, while keeping track of\none consistent object.\n\n\nLocalSinkDevicesFactory : Same as above but for all available A/V\nsinks on the device.\n\n\nLinkedOperationFactory : Synchronized effect for use in the\npipeline. Imagine a 'thunder' effect that has synchronized audio and\nvideo effect.\n\n\nMultipleQualitySourceFactory : SourceFactory that can provide a\nvariety of different 'qualities' off the content. This could enable\nswitching between a lower-quality (fast for editing) and a\nhigher-quality (needed for final rendering).\n\n"});
