This is the most common case\nwhen adding a Audio+Video File to the Timeline.\nWe want to handle the TrackObject(s) separately. Maybe to offset them,\nmaybe to remove one of the TrackObject, ...\n\nWe ask to unlink a certain TrackObject (B) from its controlling\nTimelineObject (X).\nThe TimelineObject (X) looks for the ObjectFactory (O) from which\nthe TrackObject (B) was created. In this case there's only one\nObjectFactory, but there could be several in the case of\nLinkedSources.\nIt creates a new empty TimelineObject (Y) for the selected\nObjectFactory (O). That new TimelineObject is a complete clone\nof (X) except for the list of TrackObject(s) it controls.\nIt removes the TrackObject (B) from the list of objects it's\ntracking. This means that:\n\n(B) temporarily has no controlling TimelineObject.\nThe TrackObject (B) has NOT been removed from the Track to which\nit belonged.\n\n\nIt adds the TrackObject (B) to the list of objects controlled by the\nnew TimelineObject (Y).\n\n\n(B) temporarily has no controlling TimelineObject.\nThe TrackObject (B) has NOT been removed from the Track to which\nit belonged.\n\n"});
