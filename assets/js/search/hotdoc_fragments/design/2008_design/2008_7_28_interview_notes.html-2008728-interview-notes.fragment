Is a 3D animator working for a gaming company,\nso his editing needs are somewhat different than the average\nvideographer or editor. His duties include producing high-quality stills\nand shorts for promotional purposes, as well as in-game cinematics\n(ICG). Most of his sequences are pre-rendered, and brought in as\nsequenced images. In general, the sequences are rendered to their\nfinished length and only occasionally are the sequences trimmed down.\nAfter lunch with M, he showed me how he performed simple editing tasks\nin Adobe Premiere. He discussed how Premiere differed from its\nalternatives. For comparison he also performed similar tasks in After\nEffects. He commented that Premiere doesn't focus on individual frames.\nAfter Effects is much more focused on frame-accurate editing and\nkeyframing. M. said that he actually preferred using After Effects for\nmost editing tasks. He also showed me how Maya handles animation through\ntwo separate interfaces: the dope sheet, and the graph. The dope sheet\nhearkens back to traditional 2D animation as a means of timing lip\nmovements to speech sounds. The property graph directly displays the\nmathematics of a property as they change over time.\n"});
