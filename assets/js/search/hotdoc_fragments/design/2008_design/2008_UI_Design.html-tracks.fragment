Tracks represent separate\noutput channels with a single media type. Within a track, all objects\nhave the same media type, and there is at least one track in the\ntimeline for every type of media that the timeline contains. The user\ndoes not add or remove tracks directly: the user adds objects to the\ntimeline, and tracks are created as appropriate. Most projects will only\nhave one audio and one video track.\nTracks can be expanded or contracted. Expanded tracks stack their clips\nvertically, according to the clips' layer position (priority). When a\ntrack is collapsed, all sources appear at the same vertical position, as\nif contained within a single layer. This single layer can then be\nfurther collapsed.\n"});
