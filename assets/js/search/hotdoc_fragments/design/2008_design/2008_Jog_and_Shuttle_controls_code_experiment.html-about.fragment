It provides amongst other things a prototype for better frame\nseeking with gstreamer, which can be a starting point for pitivi. (It is\nnot the purpose to put the whole library in pitivi, I will rewrite it\ncustomized for pitivi so it can be applied as a patch.) The prototype is\nan attempt to deliver the control that serious video editors want. As it\nhas just been developed, it might contain some rough edges still. I will\ndiscuss it following its MVC structure:\nModel (gstreamer) <-> Controller (pure python) <-> View\n(pygtk/wxpython)\n"});
