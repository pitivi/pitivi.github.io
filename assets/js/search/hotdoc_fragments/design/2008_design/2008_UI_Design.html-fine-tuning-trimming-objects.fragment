By default, the in or out point of a clip should be\nedge-snapped (so that it is easy to put the clip back the way it was).\nThe UI should constrain the setting of in/out point so that sources\ncan't be stretched beyond maximum native duration. clicking and\ndragging a trimming handle should not change the current selection\n\nFirst, the user moves the mouse over the desired clip's trimming handle\n\nThe cursor changes to a left- or right-edge trimming cursor.\n\nClick-and drag sets the in or out point of the clip as appropriate.\n"});
