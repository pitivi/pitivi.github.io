Dropping one source onto another causes the new source to\nbe spliced into the existing one. There's no easy way to rejoin the\nsource, though you can always stretch the existing source back to\nits original length.\nApplying a time stretch in premiere was somewhat difficult. In after\neffects, the time remapping feature made complicated frame-rate\nmanipulations a fairly straightforward keyframing process.\n\n"});
