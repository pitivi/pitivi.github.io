Sources are clips which provide data. Effects are filters\nwhich consume lower priority clips as input and produce filtered output.\nBoth Source and effect objects have properties. All properties can be\nmanipulated via the property browser, but some of properties, like audio\nvolume or video alpha, will be so commonly used that they are embedded\ndirectly onto the widget. These “embedded” interpolation curves are\nmanipulated in exactly the same way as interpolation curves in the\nproperty editor (see the Default Property Editor section) for more info.\n"});
