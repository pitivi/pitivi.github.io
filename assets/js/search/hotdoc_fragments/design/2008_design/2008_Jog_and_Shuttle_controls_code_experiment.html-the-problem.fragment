This makes video editing impossible. (You can see this effect in\nTotem by seeking to the end of the movie with an inaccurate codec. You\nwon't go to the end of the movie, but playback resumes much earlier.)\nThe most simple solution is to disable frame seeking for inaccurate\ncodecs or to transcode it to a better codec.\nA better solution would be to find a solution which can guarantee\nstability for any video codec. After doing some experiments and tests I\nfound out that:\nBased on these two observations, we need an algorithm which does the\nfollowing:\n\ngstreamer always returns the same y for the same x. So it should be\npossible to find a method so that y = f(x).\nx is always bigger than y, so in order to go the last frame we have\nto seek past the duration of the movie. So the seek timeline is\nlonger than the query timeline.\n\n"});
