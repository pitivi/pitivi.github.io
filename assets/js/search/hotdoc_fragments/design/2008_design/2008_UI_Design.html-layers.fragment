For audio, all layers within a track are mixed together\ninto a single stream. For video, all sources within a track are\ncomposited together in a single stream. The layer position determines\nthe order in which videos are composited, with the visually topmost\nlayer appearing as the top-most source in the stream.\n The user can add layers to a given track by\ndragging the track's separator bar downward. Similarly, the user can\nremove tracks by dragging the layer's separator bar upward; however,\nremoval of the bottom layer will only be permitted if the layer is\nempty. Objects within layers can be stacked arbitrarily. This is\nparticularly useful for effects, which operate lower-priority objects\nwithin the timeline.\n"});
