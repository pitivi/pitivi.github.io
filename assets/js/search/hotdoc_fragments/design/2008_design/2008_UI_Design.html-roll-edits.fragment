Sets the in-point of the left clip an the out-point of the\nright clip, keeping the total duration of both sources the constant.\nRoll edits are activated by holding the appropriate modifier key while\ndragging a trimming handle. Note that this is only expected to work when\nit is possible to set the in/out points of both sources to the same\npoint in time.\n\nFirst the user places the mouse over the appropriate trimming handle.\n\nThe user holds down the appropriate modifier key. Cursor changes from\ntrimming to roll-edit cursor.\n\nWhen the user drags the mouse, the edit points are set as appropriate.\n\nHowever, if the user releases the roll-edit modifier key, the edit\nreverts to the default trimming operation.\n"});
