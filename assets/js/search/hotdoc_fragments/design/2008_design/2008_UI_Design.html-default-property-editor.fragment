It's will be most usable when the mapping\nbetween an object's properties and their effect on the output is\nstraightforward. For example, audio volume, our video alpha. The current\nimplementation of the videobox element is a good example of what won't\nwork well with this module (a more dedicated UI focused on\ncropping/panning would needed).\nA few object properties will be static (i.e. they are time invariant).\nThese will be displayed as standard GTK+ Widgets. Other properties are\n“controllable” (i.e. time-varying). The user can directly manipulate the\ninterpolation curves for these properties through curve control points\nobjects, which we refer to as “key-frames.” A partial\nprototype of this design is available.\n\nThe user can add key-frames in two different ways ways:\nThe user can delete key-frame points in two different ways:\nGStreamer supports different interpolation modes, but only for the\nentire curve. Changing the interpolation mode for a single point isn't\npossible (we'll have to write our own interpolation code). On the other\nhand, it makes sense to treat interpolation mode as a per-point option.\nFor now setting the interpolation mode on a point will simply set the\ninterpolation mode on its parent curve.\n\nauto-generated for arbitrary objects\nuseful in the majority of cases\nbetter than nothing when no specific UI exists\nuseful when multiple objects of different types are selected -- the\ncommon properties can be presented and edited simultaneously.\n\n\nall curves will be plotted on a single graph\nkey-frames points define critical points of an interpolation curve\n\nmoving a key-frame horizontally changes its time-stamp\nthe curve is always plotted between keyframes in sorted order\n(see the key-frame demo)\nmoving a key-frame vertically sets its value\n\n\ngraph supports exactly the same selection idioms as the timeline\ncurves have different colors so they can be visually separated\na legend maps colors to curves (labels also appear alongside each\ncurve)\n\nclick-and-drag on a curve moves all its points vertically by the\nsame delta\n\n\n\n\nmoving a key-frame horizontally changes its time-stamp\nthe curve is always plotted between keyframes in sorted order\n(see the key-frame demo)\nmoving a key-frame vertically sets its value\n\n\nclick-and-drag on a curve moves all its points vertically by the\nsame delta\n\n\ndouble-clicking the curve\nselecting two key-frames on the same curve and clicking the\n“add-point” command in the tool-bar. this adds a point half-way\nbetween the two selected points.\n\n\ndouble-clicking a point\nselecting one or more points and pressing the delete-point button in\nthe tool-bar\n\n\nselect the desired curve, or a single keyframe of a curve\nset the desired mode by choosing from the interpolation mode pop-up\nmenu in the timeline toolbar.\nthis should also work if multiple curves / key-frames from multiple\ncurves are selected.\n\n"});
