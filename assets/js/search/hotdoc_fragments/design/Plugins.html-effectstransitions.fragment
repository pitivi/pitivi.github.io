fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"design/Plugins.html#effectstransitions","fragment":"Effects/Transitions\nThis kind of items represent an exception to the general concept of\nplugin, which are usually meant to be singletons by definition (only a\nsingle object for each plugin is created by the application), since\nthey're made to be applied more than one time over the timeline.\nEffects/Transitions are collected and exposed to the user as a list,\ngrouped into functional categories. This task will be accomplished by a\nspecialized SourceProvider plugin called Effect(Transition)Provider,\nexposing entry points where Effects can be inserted. The Provider takes\nalso care of creating a new effect object every time the user drags the\neffect to the timeline, thus implementing the Factory design pattern.\nEvery Effect object life-cycle starts in the moment the user drags it\ninto the timeline and ends when its is removed, during its lifetime the\nobject stores its custom preferencies in memory, while default\npreferences are stored in the same way of preferences of other plugins.\nDetailed discussion of Effects/Transitions architecture will be\ndiscussed in a separate design document.\n"});
