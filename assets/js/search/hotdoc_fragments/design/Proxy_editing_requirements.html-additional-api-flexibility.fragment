This will\nprobably use a technology similar to what we see in Pitivi's render\ndialogs.\nAllow multiple proxies per asset (for multiple resolutions, for\nexample). The application should be able to request a proxy to match\na particular context (ex: a maximum resolution or something); for\nexample, multicam editing could use very small versions if there is\na big number (ex: 16) of camera angles to be displayed\nsimultaneously. Or the media library could automatically show a\nplaying thumbnail-sized video preview when putting the mouse over a\nclip.\nAbility to save, in a project formatter's data, the following\nper-project overrides of the global app settings:\n\nA custom folder path for the proxies for that project (see also\nthe “where to store the proxies?” item in the “outstanding\nquestions” section on this page).\nWhether this project prefers fully-automated (or manual)\nhandling of proxies (Bassam said: “However the ui is chosen,\nthis should be a per project setting, not a choice of a\ndifferent application.
