fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"design/Plugins.html#plugin-deployment","fragment":"Plugin deployment\nSince simple plugins may consist of a single python file, while complex\nplugins may comprise glade interfaces, code written in other languages,\ngraphics etc.. etc.. then plugins needs to be packed.\nA convenient method is to take advantage of python eggs\n(http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs) and create an .egg\nfile for each plugin. Eggs are similar to java's jar files, they make\nvery simple the shipping and installation of new plugins since all you\nneed is to drag the .egg file inside the ./plugins directory. Eggs also\nships a standard method for exposing plugin's entry points and\ndependencies, making easy to allow cooperation/subordination among\nplugins.\nwe can expect pitivi to be shipped with some default plugins available\nfor all the users and meant to be uninstalled by the system\nadministrator only; while it is also auspicable to let users install\ncustom plugins and encourage them in writing new ones.\nDefault plugins could be placed inside the pitivi installation path (i.e\n/usr/local/pitivi/plugins), these plugins are usually installed by the\nlinux distribution facility and only users with root privileges can\nmodify them directly.\nUser plugins could be placed inside the user home directory (i.e. in\n/home/my_user/.pitivi/plugins) and can be installed/deleted/modified by\nthe user.\nPitivi should check for both the locations when searching for available\nplugins, and should use the user home to store plugin configuration\nparameters (i.e /home/my_user/.pitivi/plugin-settings).\n"});
