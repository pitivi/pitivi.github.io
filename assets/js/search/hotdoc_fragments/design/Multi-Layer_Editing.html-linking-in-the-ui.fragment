Each source must be\nin a different output channel, or the link tool will not be active. Once\nactive, clicking on the link tool links sources together. If any\nproperty common to both sources does not match, the difference between\nthem will be preserved across multiple edits. So, for example, if an\naudio clip leads a video clip by a few seconds, both sources will move\ntogether when dragged, but the offset will be preserved. If one source\nis of higher priority (i.e. lower in the timeline), the relative\npriority difference will be maintained if one source changes priority.\nTo unlink sources, select one or more sources. If it is linked, the\nunlink tool will become active. Clicking the unlink tool will break the\nlink between it and any sources to which it is linked. If the sources to\nwhich it is linked are in turn linked to other sources, they're links\nwill be left intact (unless they too are in the current selection).\n"});
