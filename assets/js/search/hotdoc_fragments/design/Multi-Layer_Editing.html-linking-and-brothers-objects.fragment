A source can have one linked\nsource for every separate output track in the project. Currently this\nmeans that video sources can be linked to audio sources, and audio\nsources can be linked to video sources. Along with support for variable\nnumbers of tracks will come support for multi-clip linking. Finally, one\ntrack can be linked to another track, in which case everything that is\ndone to one track is also done to in accordance with the brother\nprinciple. This is the case, for example, between the default audio and\nvideo tracks.\nA single file might provide audio and video streams, but these are each\nhandled separately within PiTiVi. In order to maintain some coherence\nbetween the two streams, we use the concept of a brother. There is a\nfamilial link between the two sources: some piece of genetic information\nis shared. An object with siblings always knows how to create or find\nits siblings. When an objects siblings are cerated, they are\nautomatically linked together. So, for example, if a video source is\nadded to a video track which is linked to an audio track, the video\nsource's brother(s) are created, and then linked together.\n"});
