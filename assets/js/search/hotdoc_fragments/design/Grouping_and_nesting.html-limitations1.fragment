fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"design/Grouping_and_nesting.html#limitations1","fragment":"Limitations\nIf a group is representable as a single object, then it cannot span\nnon-contiguous layers in the timeline. Specifically, in current video\neditors it is possible to create a group that contains (partially\ntransparent) content at Layer 1 and Layer 3 but none at Layer 2, so that\na timeline object that is not part of the group may be blended between\ntwo objects that are part of the group. (In my view, this behavior is\nnot really desirable, and the simplicity of “a group is a timeline\nobject” is worth the loss of functionality.)\n"});
