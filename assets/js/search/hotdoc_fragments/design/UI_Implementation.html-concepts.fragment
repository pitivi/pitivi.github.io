Existing video editors use the term\ntrack to refer to a UI object which represents a stream of video\nwith a sequence of sources. PiTiVi refers to this as a composition.\nThe term track in PiTiVi means a separate channel of output: for\nexample, audio and video are in separate tracks.\nThis is distinguished from the concept of a layer which is directly\nrelated to the notion of compositing. Within a track, sources have a\nproperty called priority which determines what will appear when the\nplay-head reaches a given position in the timeline. By default, the\nsource with the lowest numerical priority is displayed. Adding effects\nto a composition enables multiple sources to be composited together.\nPriority is used to determine which sources will be used by an effect as\ninput.\n\nbasic editing\nbasic effects\ncompositing\nmulti-track editing\nmulti-layer editing*\nmultiple selection\nnoun-verb interaction\ndirect manipulation wherever possible\nleaving behavior up to the core implementation\n\n"});
