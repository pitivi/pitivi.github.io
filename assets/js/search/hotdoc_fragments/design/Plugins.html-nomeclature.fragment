In respect to\nextension point we'll define “host” the component (usually pitivi but\nalso plugins can be extended) that exposes the extension point, and\n“extender” the component that plugs into the extension point in order to\nprovide additional features to the host component. Every extension point\nis characterized by a contract that both the parts must subscrive in\norder to interact.\n"});
