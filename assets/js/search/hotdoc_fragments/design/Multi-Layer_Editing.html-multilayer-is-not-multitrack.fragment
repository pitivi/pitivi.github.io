In\nPiTiVi at 'track' is a separate channel of output. A layer is a separate\ninput stream within a track. Multiple layers in a track combined into a\nsingle output stream. Layers within a track have the same media type as\nthe track itself.\nTracks, on the other hand, may be retained as separate output streams in\nthe final output. All sources in a track have the same media type, but\ndifferent tracks can have any media type that PiTiVi supports. For\nexample, a project might involve a DVD featuring multiple angles. The\nalternate angles are kept on separate video tracks. Or, a project might\nfeature separate audio tracks in foreign languages. But there is no\nlimit to what you can achieve with multiple tracks. For example, a\nplug-in might allow creating stereoscopic movies using two synchronized\nvideo tracks. But that's not all: future releases of PiTiVi will support\nother media types. Subtitle information could be kept on a subtitle\ntrack, or midi data used to control synthesizers and/or lighting systems\ncould be kept on a score track and edited alongside the video.\n"});
