Some of this design has been\nimplemented in the 2008_SOC_BLEWIS branch, and these changes will be\ngradually merged into trunk.\nThe goal of the design is to build a UI which supports the following\nfeatures:\n(*) It is important to distinguish between a track, and a layer\nin application terminology. Existing video editors use the term\ntrack to refer to a UI object which represents a stream of video\nwith a sequence of sources. PiTiVi refers to this as a composition.\nThe term track in PiTiVi means a separate channel of output: for\nexample, audio and video are in separate tracks. The Timeline class\ncontains one TimelineComposition for each of its output tracks.\nCurrently these are hard-coded to audiocomp and videocomp, but in the\nfuture multiple audio and video output tracks will be supported. This\nwill enable things like multi-language sound tracks, or multi-angle\nvideo sequences.\nThis is distinguished from the concept of a layer which is directly\nrelated to the notion of compositing. Within a track, sources have a\nproperty called priority which determines what will appear when the\nplay-head reaches a given position in the timeline. By default, the\nsource with the lowest numerical priority is displayed. Adding effects\nto a composition enables multiple sources to be composited together.\nPriority is used to determine which sources will be used by an effect as\ninput.\n\nmulti-track editing\nmulti-layer editing*\nmultiple selection\nnoun-verb interaction\ndirect manipulation\nedge snapping\nmultiple-level undo/redo support\n\n"});
