In\nthis variant, the keyframe interpolation graphs have been moved directly\nbelow the timeline. Selecting any object (or group of objects, the\ncolor-balance effect in this mock-up is selected) causes its properties\nto be displayed in the property editing region below. Not shown are the\nkey-frame handles, which would not become visible until objects within\nthe key-frame window are selected.\nAll keyframed properties are initially flat lines. These lines can be\nmoved up or down simply by clicking/dragging.\nAt this point it is not yet clear which variant would be preferable. It\nis also not yet clear how the user will add or remove key-frames.\nPossibilities are:\n\n\nclick directly on the graph and a new keyframe appears if one hasn't\nbeen created (means that the line as a whole isn't movable. have to\nselect both end-points)\nselect a keyfame then click “add” (user can't control where new\nframe is added, so a second adjustment step is required)\n\n"});
