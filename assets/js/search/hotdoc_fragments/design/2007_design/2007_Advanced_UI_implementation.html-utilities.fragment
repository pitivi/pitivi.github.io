This file\nalso provides the SmartGroup class, which extends goocanvas.Group with\nautomatic recalculation of size and position.\nThe code in this file is intended to be as reusable and generic as\npossible. Its goal is to overcome some limitations of goocanvas which\nmake programming dynamic, reactive interfaces more challenging than\nnecessary. Code in this file is also used by the simple timeline.\n"});
