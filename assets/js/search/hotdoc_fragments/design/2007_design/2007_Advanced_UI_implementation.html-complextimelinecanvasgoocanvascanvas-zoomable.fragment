The canvas creates one ComplexTrack item\nfor ComplexTrack item for each top-level composition within a timeline.\nPiTiVi core doesn't yet support multi-track editing, but this support is\nplanned. ComplexTracks should be able to handle creating/destroying\ntracks dynamically.\nIn addition to the timeline itself, this widget keeps track of a number\nof important details about the timeline: current edit points, playhead\nposition, current tool (only razor or pointer, at present), and the\ncurrent selection.\nMouse and pointer events received by this widget are routed to the\nselection or the current active tool. Keyboard events are handled here\ndirectly depending on the current active tool.\n"});
