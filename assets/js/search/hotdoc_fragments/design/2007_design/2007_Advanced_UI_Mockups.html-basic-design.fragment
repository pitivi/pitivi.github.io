In this case, properties interpolation graphs are overlaid\natop source widgets directly. The properties can be shown/hidden with\nthe property selection popup at the bottom of the source. In addition,\nthe interpolation mode can be set for the currently selected\ninterpolation graph. The interpolation graph is manipulated with\n“keyframes” which are dragable handles that adjust the timestamp and\nkeyframe.\n\n\nWhen a source in the timeline moves, the viewer needs to seek just\nbefore that source's in point in the timeline.\nWhen the user adjusts the in-point or out-point of a source, the\nviewer needs to seek to the new in or out point in the source\nWhen the user adjusts a keyframe, the viewer needs to seek to that\npoint in the timeline and show the user a preview of the change\n\n"});
