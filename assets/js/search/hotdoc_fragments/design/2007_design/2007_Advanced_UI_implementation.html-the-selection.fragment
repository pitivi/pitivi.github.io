The selection consists of a set of objects implementing the\nSelectable interface.\nThe canvas keeps track of whether or not objects are selected. Objects\nin the timeline always pass pointer events up to their parent group. If\nan event reaches the root item group, a test is performed to determine\nif the object should be added to the current selection. If this test\npasses, the objects select() method is called.\nThe selection also identifies a primary object: this is the object with\nwhich the user is directly interacting with, i.e. the source of the\npointer event. Certain operations make the most sense in the context of\na single active object. For example, if the user selects several sources\nand then drags one of them, this object will be used as a reference\npoint for edge snapping.\nFinally, the user is provided with a few tool-bar commands which\nmanipulate the selection explicitly.\n"});
