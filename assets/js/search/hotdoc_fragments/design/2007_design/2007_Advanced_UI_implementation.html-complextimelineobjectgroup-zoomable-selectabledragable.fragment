It is a base\nclass for all objects represented in the ComplexTimeline. When created,\nit is given a reference to a TimelineObject, and connects to that\nobject's start-duration-changed signal. When the core object's start\nand duration change, the UI object's horizontal position and width are\nupdated. When the core object's layer position changes, the vertical\nposition is updated.\nEvery TimelineObject has a reference to a Content object which is\ndisplayed inside of the TimelineObject. This object may be audio or\nvideo. The Content object can change height or visibility depending on\nits state. The parent ComplexTimelineObject must keep track of the\nheight of its content region and adjust its height accordingly.\nComplexTimelineObjects have drag handles which allow them to be directly\nresized. See the Handle class documentation for more information.\n"});
