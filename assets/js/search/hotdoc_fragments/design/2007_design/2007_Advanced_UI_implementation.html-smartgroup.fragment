They work more-or-less like HBox and VBox in gtk. What you\nneed to know about smart group is:\nThis is currently accomplished by using property notification signals.\nSmartGroup overrides the add_child method and connects to the\nnotify::x, notify::y, notify::width, and notify::height signals for each\nof its children.\n\nThe smart group keeps track of its own position: Setting the x or y\nproperties on a smartgroup will cause all the group's children to\nmove accordingly.\nThe smart group keeps track of its size: If any of the group's\nchildren change size or position, the group recomputes its width and\nheight properties.\n\n"});
