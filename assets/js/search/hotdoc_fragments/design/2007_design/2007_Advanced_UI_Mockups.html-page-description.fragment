In this case, properties interpolation graphs are overlayed\natop source widgets directly. The properties can be shown/hidden with\nthe property selection popup at the bottom of the source. In addition,\nthe interpolation mode can be set for the currently selected\ninterpolation graph. The interpolation graph is manipulated with\n\u201ckeyframes\u201d which are dragable handles that adjust the timestamp and\nkeyframe.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a source in the timeline moves, the viewer needs to seek just\nbefore that source's in point in the timeline.</li>\n<li>When the user adjusts the in-point or out-point of a source, the\nviewer nees to seek to the new in or out point in the source</li>\n<li>When the user adjusts a keyframe, the viewer needs to seek to that\npoint in the timeline and show the user a preview of the change</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"image:advanced_ui_direct_keyframes.png\">image:advanced_ui_direct_keyframes.png</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"separatedkeyframes-variant\">Separated-keyframes variant</h2>\n<p>The basic design doesn't address the problem of keyframes in\nSimpleEffects, which don't have room to display interpolation graphs. In\nthis variant, the keyframe interpolation graphs have been moved directly\nbelow the timeline. Selecting any object (or group of objects, the\ncolor-balance effect in this mock-up is selected) causes its properties\nto be displayed in the property editing region below. Not shown are the\nkey-frame handles, which would not become visible until objects within\nthe key-frame window are selected.</p>\n<p>All keyframed properties are initially flat lines. These lines can be\nmoved up or down simply by clicking/draging.</p>\n<p>At this point it is not yet clear which variant would be preferable. It\nis also not yet clear how the user will add or remove key-frames.\nPossibilities are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>click directly on the graph and a new keyframe appears if one hasn't\nbeen created (means that the line as a whole isn't movable. have to\nselect both end-points)</li>\n<li>select a keyfame then click \u201cadd\u201d (user can't control where new\nframe is added, so a second adjustment step is required)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"image:advaced_ui_separated_keyframes.png\">image:advaced_ui_separated_keyframes.png</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"expandedcontracted-variant\">Expanded/Contracted Variant</h2>\n<p>The similar to the basic design, but objects can be expanded to take up\na maximal amount of screen space. This extra space is used to display\nthe interpolation graphs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"image:advanced_ui_expanded_contracted.png\">image:advanced_ui_expanded_contracted.png</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"kiddos-design\">Kiddo's Design</h1>\n<h2 id=\"general-timeline-overview\">General Timeline Overview</h2>\n<p>Features in this mockup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nice looking clips representation on the timeline, maybe in cairo?</li>\n<li>arrows on the left and right sides of the clips to allow setting the\nbeginning/end (only works in the advanced timeline, because the\nclips' widths are proportional to their duration). If the user zooms\nout or the clip is too short, these arrows should \u201csqueeze\u201d\nthemselves, and, below a certain threshold, disappear completely.\nThe user will still be able to manipulate the begin/end points by\ndragging the sides (borders) of the clip.</li>\n<li>thumbnails displayed when enough space is available <em>and when the\nuser has not deactivated them in the preferences</em></li>\n<li>notice how the proportions of the various components of the UI are\ndifferent from the simple timeline. Here, the video preview and\nmedia library are smaller, pushed to the top, to leave a lot more\nspace for the timeline itself. In a multitrack non-linear editor,\nyou want the timeline to be the main zone of interaction and\nmaximize the amount of space you have to play with it</li>\n<li>waveform previews for audio, ripped straight out of\n<a href=\"http://www.jokosher.org\">Jokosher</a></li>\n<li>the layer buttons on the left are there just for making the mockup\nlook less empty, they should be replaced by relevant ones</li>\n<li>notice the transition indicators on the bottom clip and the\ntop-right clip: some white \u201ccurve\u201d allows you to see the speed of\ntransitions such as crossfades and fade-in/out</li>\n<li>the clip displayed on the layer \u201cbg actors\u201d has a motion curve (the\nthing called \u201cvelocity curve\u201d in Vegas Video). You might want to\nlook at Jokosher's code that was used for their audio volume curves,\nit would be great to be able to control the volume/opacity/speed of\nan audio/video clip using curves everywhere as \u201ckeyframes\u201d.</li>\n<li>this user interface's <strong>audio and video tracks are separated</strong>. Do\nnot be fooled by the looks. It was just me being lazy (and\nforgetting to show audio tracks everywhere). Basically, what you are\nseeing in this mockup is a bunch of \u201csilent clips with no audio\u201d (or\nclips whose audio tracks were removed in favor of one sound track)</li>\n<li>\u201cpyrotechs\u201d and \u201cbg actors\u201d are just track \u201cnames\u201d (or \u201clabels\u201d)</li>\n<li>this was made from a screenshot of the French version of pitivi, so\na few terms might seem odd. For example \u201cPiste vid\u00e9o\u201d means \u201cVideo\ntrack\u201d.</li>\n<li>this whole timeline is *HUGE*. This would be in a case where the\nuser has big toolbars in his gnome preferences, and where he\nstretched up the layer's height (because, realistically, the layer\nheights should be maybe \u00bd of that to avoid eating up too much screen\nheight).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"Pitivi-advanced-mockup.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Pitivi-advanced-mockup.png\"></p>\n<p>I would be a strong proponent in favor of <strong>having only one timeline for\nPiTiVi, the advanced one</strong>. I mean, I really don't think that a\nmultitrack UI like that is harder than the \u201cimovie-simplified like\u201d\ncounterpart. This multitrack interface <strong>is</strong> scalable from the newbie\nto the professional, <em>if</em> you design, <em>think</em> the user interface really\nwell (you can leave that to me ;). <strong>I believe a \u201cdirect manipulation\u201d\nmultitrack \u201ctime-proportional\u201d timeline interface kicks the hell out of\nthe current \u201csimplified interface\u201d</strong>, and will need no significant\nlearning curve, even for grandma. The rest can be done with nice\ntutorial screencasts that I would gladly provide, and that would give\nthe advantage of not splitting the coding workforce over two timelines.\nDo one thing, and do it so well that grandma's jaw drops (not from\nnatural cause)! --<a href=\"User:Kiddo.md\">Kiddo</a> 23:28, 10 June 2007\n(BST)</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
