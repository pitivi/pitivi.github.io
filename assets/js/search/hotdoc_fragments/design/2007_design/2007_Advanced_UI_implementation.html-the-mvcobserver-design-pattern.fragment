Core objects emit\nsignals which prompt changes in the UI. UI elements wrap core objects to\nmanipulate data, which in turn emit signals. The observer pattern allows\nthe user interface to listen for changes in the core without coupling\nthe core to the UI.\nWe use pygobject to provide support for the observer pattern in the\ncore. The user interface depends on pygtk and pygoocanvas, both of which\nare based on GObject.\n"});
