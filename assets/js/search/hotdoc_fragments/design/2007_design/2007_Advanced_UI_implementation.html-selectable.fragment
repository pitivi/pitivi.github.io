This is kept strictly separate from Dragable, as\nthere is a use case for selectable objects which cannot be moved by the\nuser, as well as a use case for dragable objects which should never\nbecome part of the current selection. Objects are selected with\nSelect(), and deselected with Deselect(). Objects are notified of their\nselection status through the selected() and deselected() method calls.\nBeing part of the selection implies that the object represents data that\ncan be manipulated. To this end, all Selectable objects provide a\ncore_object property. The list of all selected core objects can be\nobtained with the getSelectedCoreObjects class method.\nThe current selection is a set of Selectable objects, and any command\nwhich affects the current selection operates on these objects (or the\ncore objects which they represent). To facilitate this, the interface\nprovides class methods to iterate over all instances of selectable\nobjects in various ways.\n"});
