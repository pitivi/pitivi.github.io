Future\nreleases will support not just multiple audio and video tracks, but\nother media types as well. The key concept of tracks is linking.\nLinking allows sources within separate tracks to work together.\nIndividual tracks can also be enabled or disabled for preview and\nproject rendering. Also, Moving sources between tracks is not ordinarily\npossible.\n"});
