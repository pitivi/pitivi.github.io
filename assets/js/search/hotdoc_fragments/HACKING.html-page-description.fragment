fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"HACKING.html#page-description","fragment":"To develop Pitivi on Linux you need to set up a development environment,\nas described below. For other platforms, get in\ntouch with us.\nBy setting up a development environment, you create a\nflatpak sandbox containing all the Pitivi\ndependencies. The sandbox is then used to run Pitivi and the unittests,\nwithout messing your system.\nStart by installing both flatpak\nand flatpak-builder on your system.\nCreate a development environment folder and get the Pitivi source\ncode into it:\nWhenever you want to hack on Pitivi, start a new terminal and enter the\ndevelopment environment:\nWhen creating the sandbox from scratch it can take up to a few hours,\ndepending on your internet connection speed and the CPU. Note the prompt\nchanges:\nBy entering the development environment, you get:\nNow that you are in the development environment, try running the\nunittests:\nHack away, and check the effect of your changes by simply running:\nTo update the dependencies installed in the sandbox, run:\nThat will actually recreate the sandbox prefix, updating all\ndependencies from their git repos and tarballs as defined in the\nflatpak\nmanifest.\nThe sandbox we set up has access to the host file system. This allows\nrunning the Python modules in pitivi-dev/pitivi/pitivi/... on top of\nthe GNOME + Pitivi dependencies system installed in the sandbox.\nWithout this trick, you'd have to build and install every time when you\nchange a .py file, to be able to test how it works, which would be\nannoying because it takes a non-negligible amount of time.\nWe don't actually run Pitivi 100% uninstalled. Besides the .py files\nthere are other parts which need to be built when changed or even\ninstalled before using them:\nSelect parts of Pitivi are written in C, such as the audio envelope\nrenderer for the audio clips. Build them with ninja -C mesonbuild/ or\nwith our very own alias build, which is the same thing. No need to\ninstall them.\nSimilarly, bin/pitivi.py.in and pitivi/configure.py.in also need\nto be built with build, to regenerate the corresponding .py files.\nThe translations need to be built and installed, which can be done\nwith binstall. See \"Switching locales\" below.\nIf you have to work on say, GStreamer Editing\nServices\nwhich is built using the Meson build system, first clone it into your\npitivi-dev folder:\nPrepare its build directory using the setup alias which runs meson. This has\nto be done only once:\nBuild and install it in the sandbox:\nIn the (ptv-flatpak) development environment meson and ninja are aliases\nwhich run meson and ninja in the flatpak sandbox.\nNOTE: When updating the environment with ptvenv --update, it will use your\nlocal dependencies repositories it finds in the pitivi-dev folder, instead of\nthe default remote repositories. This means you have to update them yourself.\nAlso beware that it only takes into account committed changes.\nIf the project you are working on is built with other tools, make sure\nthey are run in the sandbox by using ptvenv. For example:\nTo profile a Pitivi run, simply set the PITIVI_PROFILING environment\nvariable to 1, like so:\nA file named pitivi-runstats will be created in the current directory, a handy tool to examine it is gprof2dot.py, install it with:\nThen run:\nYou can then inspect the call tree profile with your preferred image viewer:\nTo see how Pitivi looks in a different locale, use:\nPay attention the translations in the sandbox are not automatically\nupdated when you git pull. You can update them by updating your\nsandbox (ptvenv --update) or by reinstalling Pitivi in the sandbox:\n\na Flatpak sandbox\nwith dependencies and some development tools, in pitivi-dev/pitivi-prefix\n\nthe Meson build directory,\nin pitivi-dev/pitivi/mesonbuild\n\nsome aliases for the build tools, such as ninja, so they are executed in the sandbox.\n\n\n\nSelect parts of Pitivi are written in C, such as the audio envelope\nrenderer for the audio clips. Build them with ninja -C mesonbuild/ or\nwith our very own alias build, which is the same thing.
