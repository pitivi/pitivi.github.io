Non-Linear Engine is\nmedia-agnostic and has no notions of video editing. Non-Linear\nEngine is basically composed of a few thread-safe GStreamer plugins\nwhich allow compositing and mixing and translating the project's\ntimeline dynamically into a GStreamer pipeline.\n\nGStreamer, a multimedia\nframework that allows us to do anything multimedia-related. It is\nvery flexible and uses elements that are packaged in the form of\nplugins. These elements can be codecs/muxers/demuxers/effects, etc.\n\n\nGLib is a low level C library that provides fundamental types and\nalgorithms. It is a base upon which everything is constructed. Since\nwe interact with GStreamer through GES, in Pitivi\nwe can see the GLib basic types (gboolean, gchar, gint, gfloat,\ngdouble etc).\n\nGObject is a part of\nGLib that provides an object-oriented framework for C.\n\n"});
