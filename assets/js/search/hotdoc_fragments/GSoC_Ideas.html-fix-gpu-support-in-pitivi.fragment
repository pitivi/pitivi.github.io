This project is about\nenabling GL plugins for compositing and rendering, and fixing any issue that\nshows up. The second part would be about making sure hardware accelerated\ndecoders can be used in the pipelines.\nRequirements: C. Experience with GStreamer is mandatory. Minimal experience\ncontributing to Pitivi including unit tests. Experience with OpenGL is a plus.\n"});
