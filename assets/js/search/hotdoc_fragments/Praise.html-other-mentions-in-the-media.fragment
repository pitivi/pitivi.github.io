After seeing a comment in this subreddit, I\ndecided to give Pitivi a chance, and I was blown away. It is not the\nmost feature-packed editor (kdenlive), but it did exactly what I\nneeded it to do: I imported video, made cuts, added transitions, added\ntitles, and rendered out a 30min video to ProRes. Not a single glitch\nin the whole process. Also, it looks great! If any Pitivi developers\nare reading, THANK YOU! You have made a functional video editor under\nLinux. Looking forward to your 1.0 release.”\n— theray76 on\nReddit,\n2017-01-07\n“I've spent years looking for a simple, stable video editor to fit\ninto my Linux (GNOME) desktop experience. Flatpak, and Pitivi\ninstallation via flapak is simple and it works. Pitivi 0.96 is a great\nrelease. It's stable, responsive, and it works. Kudos to the Pitivi\ndevelopers and wider community. [...] if you're like me, and you've\nbeen waiting on the sidelines for a simple, stable video editor for\nLinux (and in particular the GNOME/GTK environment) then I recommend\nyou give Pitivi 0.96 a try.”\n— maheart on\nReddit,\n2016-07-28\n(...) \"I have worked as video editor in my earlier life (before I\nbecame software programmer), and used Final Cut Pro. I have always\nbeen a Linux user though, and have meddled with everything that exist\nevery single year. Cinelerra was always the fall-back that would never\nreally let me down because it was frank about its crashes and they\nwere possible to navigate around.\nIn later years, I did find Pitivi to be a possible replacement for\nsimple out-to-blog cuts. Especially the version before they added\nfilters. Sadly, the filters-version exposed lots of bugs in the\nunderlying stack and everything became dog-slow and probably quite\nunstable. I just stuck with that old (now very old) version.\nHowever, the new GES-backed 0.9-line that is aiming at becoming 1.0 is\nsomething totally different. It is really shaping up to becoming a\nquite awesome little video editor and I will be donating happily.\"\n(...)\n— Odin Hørthe Omdal on the 2014 fundraiser coverage article on OMG!\nUbuntu!,\nFebruary 24, 2014\n"});
