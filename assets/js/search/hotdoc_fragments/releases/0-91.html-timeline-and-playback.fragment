A 2K clip? Not a problem anymore (unless\nyou're still running on a 286 or something).\nMuch faster and prettier video thumbnails on the timeline, with\ntwo-stage caching and adaptive CPU usage throttling\nMuch faster and more accurate audio waveforms, with on-disk caching\nManual layers management interface, layer reordering\nThe timeline toolbar is now vertical and sports improved “Split”,\n“Group” and “Ungroup” icons. It also does away with obsolete\nbuttons.\nAutomatic rippling (a.k.a. “magnetic”, elastic, fantastic) timeline\nmode: this makes your clips behave like magnets and prevents needing\nto re-arrange them manually all the time.\nAutomatically adjust the zoom when inserting to the end of the\ntimeline\nNew icons for split, group/ungroup and align\nClip snapping indicator\n\n"});
