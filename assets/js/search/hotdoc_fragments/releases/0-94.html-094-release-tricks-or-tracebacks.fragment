This is mostly a incremental bugfixing release, so\nmake sure to see the 0.91, 0.92\nand 0.93 release notes to get the full picture.\nThis is considered a beta release. As per the feedback we've\nreceived since 0.91 and the many fixes we've made since then, we are\nconfident that the new release series is of much higher quality than the\n0.15 series and older.\nThis release works well for us and we make nice movies with it. Try it\nout, have fun and report detailed bugs for issues you may encounter!\n"});
