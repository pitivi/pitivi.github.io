This is mostly an incremental\nbugfixing release, so make sure to see the 0.91,\n0.92, 0.93 and\n0.94 release notes to get the full picture.\nThis is considered a beta release since the “big picture” remains\n“making Pitivi stable” (that's why the next release will bring proxy\nediting). Note that while we use the word “beta” here, this is the\nlatest “stable” release, and is the one we recommend over all previous\nones.\nPitivi works well for us and we make nice movies with it. Try it out,\nhave fun and report detailed bugs for issues you may encounter!\nBlog post associated with this release:\nhttp://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2015/11/19/pitivi-0-95-enfant-suisse/\n"});
