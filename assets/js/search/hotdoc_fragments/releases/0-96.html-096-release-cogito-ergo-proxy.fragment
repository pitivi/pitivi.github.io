Note that while we use the word “beta” here,\nthis is the latest “stable” release, and is the one we recommend over\nall previous ones.\nPitivi works well for us and we make nice movies with it. Try it out,\nhave fun and report detailed bugs for issues you may encounter!\nBlog post associated with this release:\nhttps://pitivi.wordpress.com/2016/06/30/pitivi-0-96-cogito-ergo-proxy/\n"});
