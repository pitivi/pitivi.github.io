This is a incremental bugfixing release, so please\nmake sure to see the 0.91 release notes to get the\nfull picture.\nWARNING: Please keep in mind\nthat this is still an alpha release, so there may be some bugs we\nhaven't found yet. We appreciate your feedback, so try it out, let us\nknow how well it works for you and report detailed bugs for issues you\nmay encounter. Again, this is not yet\nconsidered production-ready software.\nThat said, one month after 0.91, with the feedback we\nhave received so far, we are pretty confident that the new release\nseries is of much higher quality than the 0.15 series\nand older.\n"});
