Please join us to make\nit work up to your expectations! See the existing title editor\nbugs.\nThe transformation box reimplementation is still ongoing (see bug\n708495).\nTranslations are not all fully up to date.\nThe automated codecs installer is (still) broken. See bug\n686182 and GES\nbug 686181.\nThe automatic clip aligner feature does not work. We need someone to\nport it to use our new audio waveforms processing\nmodule.\n\nNo dialog to install missing codecs after discovering\nclips, and no\nerror gets raised in that case. This means that the clip will\n“appear” to have imported correctly, but if you try inserting it\ninto the timeline you may get errors in the background or Pitivi's\nUI may hang.\n\n"});
