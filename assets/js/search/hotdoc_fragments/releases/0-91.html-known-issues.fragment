fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"releases/0-91.html#known-issues","fragment":"Known issues\nSee the list of currently known\nissues,\nthe 0.91-specific\nissues\nand the list of bugs that need re-testing with\n0.91\n(you can help!)\n\nLayer management interface is missing features.\nThe title editor UI is very primitive and probably buggy. Please\njoin us to make it work up to your expectations! See the existing\ntitle editor\nbugs.\nThe transformation box has been disabled (we need someone to fix\nit).\nThe user manual is completely outdated (it references the\n0.15 series). We are looking for someone to take\non the role of writing the Pitivi user guide. Please get in touch if\nyou love writing and are interested in helping out.\nTranslations are not all fully up to date.\nThe Media Library does not generate missing thumbnails. See\nGStreamer bug\n667203 for\ndetails.\nThe ruler has not been ported to\nClutter, so it\nwill not be in sync with the rest of the timeline while\nautoscrolling.\nThe automated codecs installer is (still) broken. See bug\n686182 and GES\nbug 686181.\nThe automatic clip aligner feature does not work. We need someone to\nport it to use our new audio waveforms processing\nmodule.\nIf xptv file support is important to you, we urgently need someone\nto get involved in fixing/refactoring the xptv formatter module in\nGES. If no interest is shown after a few releases, support for this\nlegacy file format may be dropped.\n\nNo dialog to install missing codecs after discovering\nclips, and no\nerror gets raised in that case. This means that the clip will\n“appear” to have imported correctly, but if you try inserting it\ninto the timeline you may get errors in the background or Pitivi's\nUI may hang.\n\n"});
