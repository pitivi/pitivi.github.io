It now\nopens a separate window that tries to show the clip at 1:1 size\nwhenever possible. This window can be dismissed by clicking the\nclose button or clicking anywhere outside the window, so there is no\nreduction of efficiency compared to the old approach.\nUse Nautilus/Totem’s thumbnails and conform to the new version of\nthe Freedesktop specification for thumbnail directories. The result\nis prettier and we don’t have to do processing in most cases, which\nmeans even faster import/loading times.\nAsynchroneous (non-blocking) and much faster clip importing\nThe media library keeps itself sorted alphabetically as you import\nfiles, without any additional performance hit.\nPrevent playing back clip previews in double (that was a subtle one,\nas windows were exactly on top of each other)\nMake special characters show up correctly in the media library’s\niconview mode, remove the ancient filename shortening code and rely\non Pango instead.\nAvoid excessive work when searching clips in the media library,\nimproving performance\nHandle special characters in the media library’s search entry\nUse the system’s default image viewer to preview images\n\n"});
