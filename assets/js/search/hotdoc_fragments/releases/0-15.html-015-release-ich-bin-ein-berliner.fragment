The next releases will be based on GStreamer Editing Services\n(GES) and should thus depart significantly from this release in terms of\nperformance, features and stability.\nFor the best user experience, the PiTiVi team strongly recommends that\nusers have all the latest official GStreamer libraries and plugins\ninstalled.\n"});
