I did do a rather large commit, but\nthis has left the SoC branch in a somewhat messy state, as most of the\ncode is completely untested. I would like to continue working on this,\nbut for the next two days I will be occupied with school and family\nissues. Thursday and friday are out, because my car needs attention\n(water pump leak), and instruction begins on the 27th. So it's not\nlooking good for the short term.\nOn the whole, I feel pleased with my earlier work, but I am a bit\ndisappointed at the lack of progress during the later half of the\nsummer. Stay tuned for future developments. I think this was a great\nexperience, and I feel that I have learned a great deal from\nparticipating in Summer of Code.\n"});
