It displays time markers and at lower zoom levels the successive frames. Currently it's implemented in Python as a GTK3 widget, relying on the legacy cairo based drawing model. This project involves rewriting the ruler as a standalone, native Rust widget using GTK4's modern GSK rendering model.\nRequirements: Rust. Minimal experience contributing to any Rust based GTK application. Familiarity with Python, GES and contributions to Pitivi a plus.\n"});
