The repos are downloaded and cached by\nthe pre-commit tool on demand. These hooks are executed each in their own\nown virtualenv.\nA special case is the local repo which groups the hooks installed alongside\nthe pre-commit framework, in the sandbox. We only need the pylint hook to be\nrun in the sandbox instead of in its own virtualenv, such that it has access\nto the Python environment in the sandbox.\nTo update pylint, follow the instructions for updating the Python\ndependencies.\nTo update the regular hooks, take the repos one by one, check what is the latest\nversion and update the entry in the .pre-commit-config.yaml file. After\nupdating each repo, validate the entire codebase and fix all the newfound\nerrors.\nFor example, suppose we just updated the\nhttps://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks.git repo to revision v3.4.0:\nTo run the check-yaml hook on the entire codebase:\nIf you feel brave, you can use pre-commit itself to update the hooks:\nAt the end, do a final check by running all the hooks on the entire codebase:\n"});
