fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Project_history.html#page-description","fragment":"PiTiVi was started in 2004 as an “end of studies” project by Edward\nHervey and his classmates at the French computer engineering school\nEpitech. The “PiTiVi” name came from the combination of “Epitech” and\n“TV”.\nIn 2005-2007, development stalled due to various factors, including the\nfact that Edward (the only active PiTiVi developer at that time) was\nhired by Fluendo to work on GStreamer. Improving GStreamer was necessary\nin order for PiTiVi to be usable, but this meant that PiTiVi did not get\nas much direct development attention. During that time, PiTiVi was also\nrewritten in Python (it was initially written in C). A more detailed\nexplanation can be read in this blog post by Edward in 2007.\nIn early 2008, it was decided that PiTiVi had outgrown its original\ndesign specifications and needed to be re-architected. The result was\nthe 2008 Architectural Redesign. In late 2008/early 2009, it was\nannounced that Collabora Multimedia would invest developer time in\nimproving PiTiVi (and hire additional developers to accelerate its\npace). The results of Collabora's help on that front were dramatic, as\ncan be seen in the significant amount of commits in 2009-2010.\nIn late 2009/early 2010, the GES library was created to address many\narchitectural problems around non-linear editing with GStreamer.\nStarting in 2011, efforts on the PiTiVi side have been focused on\nporting to GES, cleaning and stabilizing the whole stack (PiTiVi, GES,\nGNonLin, GStreamer and related technologies like GObject introspection)\nwhile fixing longstanding bugs and adding new features.\nAs part of a website and branding facelift in 2013, the traditionally\ncamel-cased “PiTiVi” name was changed to simply “Pitivi”.\nTo this day, the project lives on, thanks to the continued efforts of\nmany dedicated people.\n\n\nWikipedia's page is currently more complete than this page. The goal\nhere is to explain, eventually, some events and design decisions\n(without needing to cite everything). You can see the overall project\nactivity throughout the years on Ohloh.*\n\n"});
