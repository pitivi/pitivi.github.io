fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"How_to_update_SDK.html#page-description","fragment":"We use the same Flatpak\nmanifest\nfor both the development environment sandbox and for the official\nbuild.\nThe Flatpak manifest is based on the org.gnome.Platform runtime which needs to\nbe updated as soon as possible after new GNOME releases take place.\nThe complexity in updating the runtime comes from the fact that we use our own\nDocker image for running the tests and this needs to be updated also.\nFirst, look in org.pitivi.Pitivi.json for the current version:\nGrep the entire repo for this runtime version and replace it with the next\nversion.\nRebuild your local dev env:\nRun the tests:\nIf all goes well, push the branch to origin!\nIf you go to Gitlab pitivi page > CI / CD >\nSchedules you can\nsee a \"Build docker image for the CI\" schedule targetting branch \"master\". This\nrebuilds every 24h the image we use for running the unittests. This image caches\nthe build of dependencies described in our Flatpak manifest.\nTo create an initial image for the new SDK, start with creating a new schedule.\nSet description \"build new image\", select the branch you just pushed (\"sdk\"),\nuncheck Active.\nGo back to the Schedules page and click the Play button to start a pipeline.\nNotice in the Last Pipeline column a link to the pipeline you just started. When\nit succeeds, you should be able to create a regular MR with your branch to merge\nit.\n"});
