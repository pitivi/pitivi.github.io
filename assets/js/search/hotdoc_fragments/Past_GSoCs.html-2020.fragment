This allowed implementing tagging of\nthe clips in the\nMedia Library.\n\nAyush Mittal simplified the Render\nDialog to avoid overwhelming people, while still allowing full control.\nThe new UI asks only about the desired render preset and quality,\ntaking care of the\nrest.\n\nVivek R implemented object tracking.\nThis required a new GStreamer element which uses\nOpenCV\nto track an object.\nA new UI perspective allows tracking objects and editing the tracked data.\nFor now it's possible to cover each tracked\nobject\nwith a colored rectangle.\n\n"});
