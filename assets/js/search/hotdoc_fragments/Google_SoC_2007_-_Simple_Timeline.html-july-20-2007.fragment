With edward's help, the volume slider on the source widget\nactually changes the volume for the clip. Today I committed a new\nrevision to the SoC branch which adds a cancel button to the editing\nwidget. This required some internal changes to the editing widget, but\nnothing too serious. Meanwhile, Edward is working on making the advanced\nUI more functional. He's got partial support for moving clips in the\nadvanced timeline, but has run afoul of some gstreamer bugs.\nI'm considering replacing the slider with a gtk.ScaleButton, since that\nwould allow the source widget to shrink down even more while allowing\nthe slider to grow to a more manageable size. I'm also thinking about a\ncustom widget for seeking that would eventually replace the simple\ngtk.HScales we've been using. It feature a much slimmer cursor, would\nsupport zooming, display a timescale, provide fancy navigation input\nsuch as jog/shuttle, and would directly show the media start/stop\npoints. I'm currently trying to design things on paper, but maybe i'll\npost a vector drawing to the wiki for comments.\nProject load/save support is in the early stages of design now. We are\nhoping to have this finished by the end of the summer, but it is a major\nchunk of work. Several contributors have begun submitting patches to\nhelp make this task easier. Edward is also beginning to explain to me\nthe intricacies of the effects/transition system in pitivi.\n"});
