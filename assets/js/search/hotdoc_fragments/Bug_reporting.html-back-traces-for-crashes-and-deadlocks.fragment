For example:\nA coredump can be investigated using gdb. Look below for the proper way\nto start gdb, but at the end instead of gdb python3 -ex ... simply run\ngdb python3 ~/coredump.\nAlternatively, if you are missing a coredump, start Pitivi in gdb as\ndescribed below, then try to reproduce the crash.\nFinally, in gdb run bt full to get the back trace for the crash.\nTip: To avoid the need to press Enter to “scroll” in gdb,\nrun set pagination 0.\nFor a deadlock, start Pitivi in gdb as described below, press Ctrl+Z\nand run thread apply all bt to get the backtraces for all the threads.\n"});
