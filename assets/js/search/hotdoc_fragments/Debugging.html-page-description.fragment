fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Debugging.html#page-description","fragment":"To debug Pitivi, you need an IDE with the ability to attach its debugger to a\nremote process. Out of the box, Pitivi supports the debugger used in\nVS Code,\nbut it can be modified to work with the Professional version of\nPyCharm,\nfor example.\nAssuming you have already installed the\nPython extension,\ninstall debugpy and open VS Code:\nIn VS Code, click the Run and Debug section on the left (or press\nCtrl+Shift+D). Press Create a launch.json file, select Python and then\nRemote Attach from the list. Leave the hostname and port as default.\nThe launch.json file should open afterwards with the generated\nconfiguration. Save the file and launch Pitivi with the PITIVI_VSCODE_DEBUG environment variable set to 1:\nPress F5 in VS Code. If the Pitivi window shows up, your debugger is working.\n"});
