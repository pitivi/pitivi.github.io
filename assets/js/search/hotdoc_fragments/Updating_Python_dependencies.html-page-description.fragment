The upstream version downloads only the source packages, for\nsecurity reasons.\nThe hotdoc and matplotlib packages are quite complex, needing additional\nbuild dependencies which have to be installed beforehand. Jan 2021 it's much\neasier to install the compiled packages instead of the source packages. When\nupstream makes it easier to use source packages we should switch.\nAfter you update the json files, try out the build by updating your local\ndevelopment environment:\nIf errors happen, you can inspect the SDK by launching bash in a sandbox, for\nexample:\n"});
