I managed to edit my\nfile correctly in the first 5 minutes of using Pitivi, which is far\nfaster than I managed with any other program!

I'm used to using Adobe Premiere Pro, so I was very impressed\nwhen I found this gem. (2010 12 31 at 21h55 UTC)\n\nrowinggolfer: Loving the git version. You guys are awesome. I\nwas a Pitivi skeptic until a couple of weeks ago, but I am using it\ndaily to get stuff done with very few issues and a tiny learning\ncurve (2010 02 21 at 13h15 GMT -5)\n\nAnts: [...] Might I say, 0.14 has blown me away, it's\nfantastic!
