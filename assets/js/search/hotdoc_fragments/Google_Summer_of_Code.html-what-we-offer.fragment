You have a fantastic learning\nopportunity to play with these technologies. We'll direct you to make\ngreat use of the tight-knit GStreamer and GTK communities so you have\nhigh-quality feedback throughout your project.\nThe dependencies for a video editor are very complex. But thanks to Flatpak we\nhave a development environment with all the dependencies in a sandbox, which\nis very easy to set up. This means you won't have to mess your system to be able\nto build the latest GStreamer. Since all of us will be using the same\ndependencies, there will be no friction due to the complex dependencies.\n"});
