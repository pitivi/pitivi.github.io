I did a number of cosmetic tweaks to get\nthe size of the SimpleSourceWidgets down (which in turn shrinks the\ntimeline itself). I also changed the way the those widgets are packed so\nthat resizing them does more to increase the size of the thumbnail\nimage. I also made it so that the thumbnail in each SimpleSourceWidget\nis updated when it's source's start point changes.\n"});
