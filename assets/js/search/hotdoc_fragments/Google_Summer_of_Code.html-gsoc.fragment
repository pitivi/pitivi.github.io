Eligibility\" in the Rules to see if you are\neligible.\nInterested students write and submit a detailed project proposal. If the\nproposal is accepted, you work on your project while being paid by Google.\nMid-term and end-term the student and the mentor both submit evaluations to\nGoogle.\nSee the section at the top of the contributing page for details why\nPitivi is important, if you're still not convinced.\nWhile a GSoC with us is one of the most fun and rewarding experiences you can\nget, you need to consider it as professional work. We expect you to be a\nreliable, hard-working person. If things don't go well because for example your\nroommates are noisy, you don't have air conditioning, or your internet\nconnection is unreliable, and you can't fix it, tell us so we can terminate your\ninternship. No excuses!\nOur policy is to ignore “theoretical” applications — to be eligible, you must\nshow you're capable. Best is to get involved early-on and make one or more\ncontributions prior to applying. We will base ourselves 90% on your involvement\nand demonstrated ability to contribute code to Pitivi. The more good-quality\npatches you’ve made, the more chances you have.\n"});
