We noticed too late the excellent additional\nDeveloper Console plugin had licensing issues, and it has been\nmerged one year later after Fabian graciously made time to rewrite it.\n\nSuhas Nayak implemented a framework for\nsupporting custom UI for effects,\ninstead of the UI generated automatically. Suhas used the new framework to\nprovide a polished UI for the frei0r-filter-3-point-color-balance and\nalpha effects.\n\nȘtefan-Adrian Popa implemented\nthe UI for the Ken-Burns\neffect,\nincluding keyframing the placement and zoom of the clips by interacting with\nthe viewer. Additionally, Ștefan fixed a lot of bugs most of them unrelated\nto his main\ntask.\n\n"});
