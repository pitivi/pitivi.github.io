I have found a legitimate video editor for Linux,\nthat is more powerful than Lightworks, that uses the latest GTK\ntechnologies, and it's available to run right now with one download,\nno proprietary counter. It's Pitivi. They just had a brand new\nversion, 0.95, and it's a huge, huge deal. I'm not joking, this is a\nreally big deal. [...] They've been essentially working on this\nrelease for over a year, and they have done SO. MUCH. WORK. It's\nalmost an entirely new product. They've redone everything. [...]\nThis looks like an actual video editor! [...] If you're familiar\nwith Final Cut this is going to be a familiar editing experience for\nyou. [...] This is a whole new deal. I'm excited.”\n— Chris Fisher on the Linux Action Show, episode\n392\n(from 22 to 32 mins), 2015\n“Pitivi es uno de los mejores editores de vídeo para Linux que he se\npuede encontrar en la actualidad. La interfaz es sencilla y agradable\na la vista, no hay complicaciones de ningún tipo… una de esas perlas\nde software que no se ven a menudo y que conviene tener siempre a\nmano.” (translated: “One of the best video editors for Linux that\nI can find today. The interface is simple and pleasing to the eye, no\ncomplications... a rare gem that you don't see often in the software\nworld, and something you should have on hand.”\n—\nUpToDown,\nSeptember 11, 2012\n“It is a testimony to Pitivi's stability that the only problems I\nfound with it were minor. (...) Obviously the big plus is the vast\nassortment of effects available, and how easy they are to configure\nand use. But the collective effect of the UI improvements (settings\npresets, detachable tabs) and other enhancements (fully adjustable\nframe rates, media previews) make for a better editing experience as\nwell.”\n—\nLinux.com,\nJuly 6th, 2011\n“What impresses me about Pitivi isn't so much that it's a flexible\nmultimedia editor — we have a handful of those already in the Linux\ncommunity. What I think sets Pitivi apart is that it makes video\nediting intuitive. I don't generally create or edit video files, but I\nwas able to jump right in with this application. I didn't have any\nneed for a manual or tutorial (...). Pitivi has an interface which\nallows people to learn by doing without a bunch of scary options or\njargon. Almost everything is drag-n-drop with this editor and I feel\nit lowers the bar for people interested in putting together their own\nvideos.”\n—\nDistroWatch,\nOctober 25th, 2010\n“(...) I have to say the work Thibault and the Pitivi guys have done\nis incredible. Truly. (...) The wide selection of effects and the ease\nin which they can be added/used is so simple and user-intuitive it\ncan’t help but stoke your creative fire. (...) The process for\nediting/adjusting clip effects in Pitivi certainly scores one up here.\nWhere OpenShot hides effect preferences behind right-clicks and extra\nwindows Pitivi puts them slapbang where you can see and access them\nequalling a usability plus. All of this is done in real-time, too: As\nsoon as you drag an effect on a clip it’s instantly applied. This\nmakes workflow irrepressibly speedy; you can see what works and what\ndoesn’t straight away. (...) I am utterly, utterly astounded by the\nquality, handling & fantastic interface this has gained in such a\nshort amount of time. It is a absolute credit to the talents of the\nteam behind this – and it’s not even released yet!”\n— OMG!\nUbuntu!\non the inclusion of special effects in September 2010\n“Overall, Pitivi is a promising application. It's a decent video\neditor with no frills, and intuitive to pick up. And in the tests I\nran, Pitivi was rock-solid. This isn't something to be taken for\ngranted. Years ago I spent time editing video with Kino for various\nprojects, and learned to save after nearly every edit or operation.”\n— ars\ntechnica,\nFebruary 1st, 2010\n"});
