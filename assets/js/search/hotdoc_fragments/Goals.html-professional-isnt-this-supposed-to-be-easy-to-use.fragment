Isn't this supposed to be easy to use?”\nYes, and yes.\nWith Pitivi's growing popularity and simple user interface, there seems\nto have been a misunderstanding in its mission: many people think our\nmain goal is to make an application for “video editing newbies”, or to\nmake a “clone” of Windows Movie Maker or iMovie. This is not entirely\naccurate. We have the following goals:\nThe confusion also stems from the common misconception that a powerful\napplication is mutually incompatible with simplicity and efficiency.\nThis is partly because there are so many applications with poorly\ndesigned user interfaces, and partly because the proprietary software\nworld has conditioned us into thinking that users must be divided in two\ngroups: “advanced” and “beginners”. There is no reason a video editor\ncan't allow complex procedures (and make them as easy as possible!)\nwhile being intuitive to learn and efficient to use for basic\noperations, even for amateurs. The reason why there has been such a\ndistinction in the proprietary software world is artificial market\nsegmentation (further reading:\n1\n2\n3).\nExecutive summary:\n\nMake a powerful, flexible video editor that can appeal to prosumers\nand professionals\nDesign it extremely well. Make its workflow elegant and intuitive.\nIf we succeed, this means we also reach the goal of “making it easy\nfor everyone to use it” possible.\n\n\nWe will make not make a crippled application. In the long run, it\nwill be powerful and flexible. Do not think that “because it doesn't\nhave lots of features right now” means that it was “designed” that\nway. It's just that we need someone to implement those features\nproperly.\nBy designing everything carefully, we strive to keep it simple for\namateurs as well.\n\n"});
