Eligibility\" in the Rules to see if you are\neligible.\nInterested students write and submit a detailed project proposal. If the\nproposal is accepted, you work on your project while being paid by Google.\nMid-term and end-term the student and the mentor both submit evaluations to\nGoogle.\nSee the section at the top of the contributing page for details why\nPitivi is important, if you're still not convinced.\nWhile a GSoC with us is one of the most fun and rewarding experiences you can\nget, you need to consider it as professional work. We expect you to be a\nreliable, hard-working person. If things don't go well because for example your\nroommates are noisy, you don't have air conditioning, or your internet\nconnection is unreliable, and you can't fix it, tell us so we can terminate your\ninternship. No excuses!\nOur policy is to ignore “theoretical” applications — to be eligible, you must\nshow you're capable. Best is to get involved early-on and make one or more\ncontributions prior to applying. We will base ourselves 90% on your involvement\nand demonstrated ability to contribute code to Pitivi. The more good-quality\npatches you’ve made, the more chances you have.\nWe are looking for smart and talented developers interested in\nmultimedia and video editing.\nThe time is very short. To make the most out of it, you need to be highly\ncommunicative. Particularly when you are stuck on a problem or don't see any\nway out. We require to see you in our chat room, that's where you can meet the\nteam, where you follow what's going on and that's where we communicate.\nYou must have experience with Python or C, depending on your project.\nKnowledge of Git, GStreamer and related technologies is a plus.\nFamiliarity with Test-Driven Development is a plus.\nYou can improve the lives of thousands of users by working on a tangible\nand fun project.\nOn the technical side, it might interest you that we use GES/GStreamer\nas backend, GTK for the UI, the Meson build system, and Flatpak to\ndistribute our own builds to users. You have a fantastic learning\nopportunity to play with these technologies. We'll direct you to make\ngreat use of the tight-knit GStreamer and GTK communities so you have\nhigh-quality feedback throughout your project.\nThe dependencies for a video editor are very complex. But thanks to Flatpak we\nhave a development environment with all the dependencies in a sandbox, which\nis very easy to set up. This means you won't have to mess your system to be able\nto build the latest GStreamer. Since all of us will be using the same\ndependencies, there will be no friction due to the complex dependencies.\n\nYou don't have to be a veteran hacker but it is important that you prove\nto us — and to yourself — that you know what you're getting into and\nthat you can handle it. You need to demonstrate that you have sufficient\ntechnical skills, motivation, and have some familiarity with the\napplication and its source code. This also ensures that you get to know\nmembers of the community and have sufficient time and information to\nproperly plan your project.\nTherefore, you should proceed like this:\n"});
