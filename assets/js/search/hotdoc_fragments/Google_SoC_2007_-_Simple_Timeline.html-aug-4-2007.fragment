I spent most of the making the application\nlogic actually pass the test cases =P. I'm debating between\nshifting focus towards the UI or towards file parsing/output. File\noutput would be the easiest to implement, UI the next easiest, with file\nparsing being the most difficult. But, I could start working on the UI\nright away, whereas I will need to converse with Edward before beginning\nwork on the file format itself.\nEdward, if you're able to read this, let me know what you think.\n"});
