I started by\nadding some of the features presented in the Simple UI\nMockups illustrations. I am now turning\nmy attention to file load and save support, even though not all of the\nsimple UI has been implemented. File Load/Save is now high priority. In\naddition, I have been creating Design Docs for\nmyself, and for other people who wish to contribute.\nDuring the development of PiTiVi this summer, we have discovered a\nnumber of gstreamer and gnonlin bugs. This means that the pitivi-soc\nbranch depends on GStreamer >= 10.9 . If you are interested in\ntrying out PiTiVi, or hacking it, you will need to follow the directions\non the Gstreamer Setup Page to configure your environment.\n"});
