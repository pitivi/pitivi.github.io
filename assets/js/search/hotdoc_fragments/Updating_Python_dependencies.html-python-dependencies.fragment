But some packages are very complex, such as hotdoc (dev docs website\ngenerator) and matplotlib (used to draw keyframes lines on the clips). These\nneed additional build dependencies which have to be installed beforehand.\nTL/DR: As of Jan 2021 it's much easier to install the compiled packages instead\nof the source packages. When upstream\nmakes it easier to use source packages we should switch back.\n"});
