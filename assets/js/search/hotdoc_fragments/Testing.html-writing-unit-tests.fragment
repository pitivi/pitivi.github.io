For\nexample the tests for pitivi/clip_properties/color.py can be found in\ntests/test_clipproperties_color.py. Note the undo/redo tests in\ntests/test_undo_* cover the same area as others such as the timeline.\nWhen writing a new test, look for similar ones to copy the initial part doing\nthe setup. Most probably you find a good example and learn something in the\nprocess. We have a large number of tests covering most of the codebase.\nWe use the unittest.mock standard Python\nmodule extensively in the\nunit tests, especially for the UI.\nUnit tests can be debugged by setting the\nPITIVI_VSCODE_DEBUG environment variable.\nIf you're curious about our unit tests, the best way to get to know them is to\nwrite a few and have us review them.
