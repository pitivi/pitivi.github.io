To learn\nabout our global mission and how we plan to achieve it, read the\nfrontpage of the Pitivi website. You can also take\na look at the tour page to find out about\ncool features.\nThe people of Pitivi have been part of the\nGStreamer developer community for many years and make sure any issues\nare solved as quickly as possible in the lower levels in order to avoid\nany bloated feature at the application level. This is what we call an\n“upstream first” approach: we fix things everywhere in the software\nstack that we depend on,\ninstead of accumulating hacks “downstream” (in our app).\nPitivi's Architecture is meant to be\nuncompromising:\nIn the long term, we not only aim for Pitivi to be an intuitive video\neditor for everyone, but also a powerful tool for professionals and\nprosumers. We are not a Windows Movie Maker clone.\n\nNo limits on audio/video formats (input/output sizes, resolutions,\nframerates, codecs and container formats, etc.)\nNo limits on the number of tracks/layers used\nNo limits on the number of combined effects\nIntuitiveness for newbies and flexibility for power users (see\nbelow)\nClean separation of the backend and UI. The backend is\nGES and it can be reused by anyone wanting to\ncreate an application on top of it.\netc.\n\n"});
