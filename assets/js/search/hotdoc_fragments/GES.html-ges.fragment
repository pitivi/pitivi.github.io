GES simplifies the\ncreation of multimedia editing applications. Basically, GES is a\ncomplete SDK for making a video\neditor (but not only that).\nTraditionally, Pitivi was a user interface and a homemade video editing\n“core” (or “backend”) that interacted directly with\nGNonLin. Starting in version\n0.91, Pitivi's core has been replaced by GES. This\nmeans that Pitivi is mostly only a user interface on top of GES.\nStarting in version 0.95, GNonLin has been replaced\nby Non-Linear Engine to improve stability.\nGES does not aim at serving the needs of Pitivi only: we are building\nthe platform of the future and breaking the cycle of failed projects.\nIndeed, other applications are already using GES or migrating to it.\n“Pitivi is one of the 'generous' projects that develops not just an\neditor, but a set of libraries to implement editors. [Applications\nbuilt on top of those libraries] are not really re-inventing the\nwheel, they can piggyback on top of the work that these folks are\ndoing, and then implement UI features that they care about the\nmost.”\n— Bassam Kurdali, director of Elephants\nDream and\nTube.﻿\nIn addition to the fact that GES encourages code reuse among audio/video\nediting software, here are some concrete advantages that we've noticed\nwhile porting Pitivi to GES:\nFurther reading for contributors:\n\nIt solves many architectural issues of the past.\nIt vastly simplifies Pitivi development:\n\nMore than 20 000 lines of code have been removed from Pitivi as\na result\n\nA big\ncleanup\nof the Pitivi codebase was done in early 2011, significantly\nreducing the amount of modules/files to deal with.\nNo more confusion between the UI and backend parts\nMuch less GStreamer knowledge is required to contribute to\nPitivi itself.\n\n\nIt has much better performance.\n\n\nMore than 20 000 lines of code have been removed from Pitivi as\na result\n\nA big\ncleanup\nof the Pitivi codebase was done in early 2011, significantly\nreducing the amount of modules/files to deal with.\nNo more confusion between the UI and backend parts\nMuch less GStreamer knowledge is required to contribute to\nPitivi itself.\n\n\nSee the Architecture page for a visual\noverview of the relationship between Pitivi, GES, Non-Linear Engine\nand other components.\nRead the GES API reference\ndocumentation\nif you need to interact with GES.
