<p>This is the first alpha release for the new version of Pitivi based on
<a href="GES.html">GES</a>, the GStreamer Editing Services library.</p>
<p>It is a major rework of the entire Pitivi
<a href="Architecture.html">architecture</a>. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing the core of Pitivi by GES; 20 thousand lines of code
removed</li>
<li>Porting to GStreamer 1.x</li>
<li>Porting to GTK+ 3.x</li>
<li>Replacing GooCanvas by Clutter for the timeline</li>
<li>An automated UI test suite, with many checks for mission-critical
parts</li>
<li>Fixing hundreds of bugs and implementing many new features</li>
<li>UI polish all over the place</li>
<li>Refactoring pretty much the entire codebase</li>
</ul>
<p>To give you a visual idea of what this meant:
<a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012-02-28-12.42.44-levelled.jpg">http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012-02-28-12.42.44-levelled.jpg</a></p>
<p><span style="background:#FF0000"><strong>WARNING</strong></span>: Please keep in mind
that this is an <em>alpha</em> release, so there may be some bugs we haven't
found yet. We appreciate your feedback, so try it out, let us know how
well it works for you and report detailed bugs for issues you may
encounter. Again, this is <span style="color:#FF0000">not yet considered
production-ready software</span>. We can't be sure until we test and
iron out the bugs! With your help, we will follow up with a beta release
and eventually a <a href="releases/1.0.md">1.0</a> release.</p>
<h2 id="top-features-of-this-release">Top features of this release</h2>
<p>These features have been documented throughout many blog posts from
January 2012 to September 2013. Take a look at the <a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/category/pitivi">“Pitivi” category of
Jeff's blog</a> for additional
details and historical context.</p>
<h3 id="media-library">Media Library</h3>
<ul>
<li>The redesigned clip previewing feature gives you more space to view
a video from the media library, yet stays out of your way. It now
opens a separate window that tries to show the clip at 1:1 size
whenever possible. This window can be dismissed by clicking the
close button or clicking anywhere outside the window, so there is no
reduction of efficiency compared to the old approach.</li>
<li>Use Nautilus/Totem’s thumbnails and conform to the new version of
the Freedesktop specification for thumbnail directories. The result
is prettier and we don’t have to do processing in most cases, which
means even faster import/loading times.</li>
<li>Asynchroneous (non-blocking) and much faster clip importing</li>
<li>The media library keeps itself sorted alphabetically as you import
files, without any additional performance hit.</li>
<li>Prevent playing back clip previews in double (that was a subtle one,
as windows were exactly on top of each other)</li>
<li>Make special characters show up correctly in the media library’s
iconview mode, remove the ancient filename shortening code and rely
on Pango instead.</li>
<li>Avoid excessive work when searching clips in the media library,
improving performance</li>
<li>Handle special characters in the media library’s search entry</li>
<li>Use the system’s default image viewer to preview images</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="timeline-and-playback">Timeline and Playback</h3>
<p><img src="releases/images/Complex_layers_whiteboard_mockup_from_desktop_summit_2011.png" alt="" title="Complex_layers_whiteboard_mockup_from_desktop_summit_2011.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Smooth, modern Clutter-based timeline with animations to enhance
usability</li>
<li>Smooth autoscrolling while playing</li>
<li>
<a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2012/03/07/trim-like-a-professional-hair-stylist/">Live preview of what you are
trimming</a>.
No more trial and error, no more fuzzying around and moving the
playhead all the time to figure out if you cut your scene right.</li>
<li>Playback performance back to the 0.13.1 levels (or possibly better).
Want to play a 1080p clip? A 2K clip? Not a problem anymore (unless
you're still running on a 286 or something).</li>
<li>Much faster and prettier video thumbnails on the timeline, with
two-stage caching and adaptive CPU usage throttling</li>
<li>Much faster and more accurate audio waveforms, with on-disk caching</li>
<li>Manual layers management interface, layer reordering</li>
<li>The timeline toolbar is now vertical and sports improved “Split”,
“Group” and “Ungroup” icons. It also does away with obsolete
buttons.</li>
<li>Automatic rippling (a.k.a. “magnetic”, elastic, fantastic) timeline
mode: this makes your clips behave like magnets and prevents needing
to re-arrange them manually all the time.</li>
<li>Automatically adjust the zoom when inserting to the end of the
timeline</li>
<li>New icons for split, group/ungroup and align</li>
<li>Clip snapping indicator</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="for-contributors-and-distributors">For contributors and distributors</h3>
<ul>
<li>Infinitely cleaner and easier to navigate codebase. See <a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2012/01/12/spring-clean-up-in-january/">this blog
post</a>
and <a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2012/02/02/aventuras-en-malaga-y-ronda/">this blog
post</a>
for an explanation and some numbers, or just look at <a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/pitivi-tree-cleanup.png">this
screenshot</a>
comparing the old and new amount of source files.</li>
<li>An awesome <a href="Testing.html">test suite</a>
</li>
<li>A revised and simplified API has been implemented in GES and
integrated in Pitivi.</li>
<li>A small <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/commit/549e1e3b">brand
adjustment</a>.
From now on, PiTiVi should simply be called “Pitivi”.</li>
<li>Dependencies are defined and checked in only one, centralized place:
check.py</li>
<li>We now use yelp-tools instead of gnome-doc-utils</li>
<li>New format for which a mimetype needs to be registered: xges</li>
<li>Commandline rendering, scripting and batch processing is now GES'
job</li>
<li>New high-resolution logo icon</li>
<li>Various pieces of documentation (README, HACKING, AUTHORS, etc.)
were updated</li>
<li>We ship an AppData file in order to show up with the correct
description in GNOME Software</li>
<li>We dropped the ChangeLog file, it weighs a ton and we have this
thing called version control systems now.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the good old “crossfade”, you can now choose from 70
industry-standard
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Engineers">SMPTE</a>)
transitions. This number doubles to 140 if you consider that each
transition can also be reversed.</li>
<li>Pitivi now inhibits the screensaver when playing and inhibits
suspend when rendering.</li>
<li>The automated backup feature now works. See <a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2012/01/25/restoring-from-backups/">this blog
post</a>
and <a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2013/09/04/fix-it-thrice/">its
sequel</a>
</li>
<li>Simplified menus</li>
<li>Fix many, many, many problems with the Media Library, project
management, keyboard shortcuts, etc.</li>
<li>Ability to save/export the current frame as an image file</li>
<li>Much faster application startup</li>
<li>Auto-hiding toolbar in fullscreen mode</li>
<li>Improved error dialogs</li>
<li>Automatically saving and restoring the state of our dynamic
detachable tabs/components.</li>
<li>Redesigned rendering progress dialog and post-render user
experience. See
<a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2012/11/15/persistent-tab-states-render-ux-polish-and-other-things/">this</a>,
<a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2013/04/28/no-more-stuck-render-dialogs/">this</a>
and <a href="http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2013/09/04/fix-it-thrice/">this</a>.</li>
<li>Enforce unicode in preset names, preventing a bug with non-ASCII
chars are used in the name of a preset</li>
<li>Allow presets with “/” in their name</li>
<li>Fix a race between clicks on the preview widget’s slider and
position updates. When using it in the media library/file chooser,
the slider would often “jump” back to its previous position instead
of seeking. The new behavior is now smooth and reliable.</li>
<li>When the viewer is undocked, provide a button to toggle fullscreen
mode</li>
<li>Specify the duration of missing/moved files when prompting the user
about their new location</li>
<li>Update effect categories, merge “Noise” and “Blur”, add a
“Compositing” category, categorize new effects</li>
<li>Automatically save the last used render directory</li>
<li>Stop rendering when the user presses Escape</li>
<li>Use symbolic icons everywhere where it makes sense (in the media
library toolbar, property reset buttons, lists, etc.)</li>
<li>Update the preview widget slider on a more frequent basis, giving it
a snappier feeling</li>
<li>Automatically save and restore the main window’s position. This is
especially useful when using detached utility windows.</li>
<li>Hide the effects toolbar when nothing is selected</li>
<li>Add a contextual help button in the render dialog to explain
container formats</li>
<li>Allow entering a frame number into the time widget</li>
<li>Keyframable (animatable) properties for all effects</li>
<li>Scale down effects thumbnails to fit better in the new listview
arrangement</li>
<li>Various improvements to the robustness of the import dialog's video
previewer</li>
<li>Ability to pause and resume rendering</li>
<li>A basic title editor</li>
<li>Filter the project loading or media file importing dialogs to only
show relevant/supported files by default</li>
<li>Only show codecs and containers with a high-enough GStreamer “rank”
to reduce the possibility of rendering problems</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the beginning, of course. See the “Bugs fixed (and even
more features)” section further below if you're hungry for more.</p>

</ul>
<p>See also <a href="attic/Dependencies.md">dependencies</a> for additional tips.</p>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Layer management interface is missing features.</li>
<li>The title editor UI is very primitive and probably buggy. Please
join us to make it work up to your expectations! See the existing
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?product=pitivi&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;component=Title%20editor">title editor
bugs</a>.</li>
<li>The transformation box has been disabled (we need someone to <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=708495">fix
it</a>).</li>
<li>The user manual is completely outdated (it references the
<a href="releases/0-15.html">0.15</a> series). We are looking for someone to take
on the role of writing the Pitivi user guide. Please get in touch if
you love writing and are interested in helping out.</li>
<li>Translations are not all fully up to date.</li>
<li>The Media Library does not generate missing thumbnails. See
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=667203">GStreamer bug
667203</a> for
details.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=708491">ruler has not been ported to
Clutter</a>, so it
will not be in sync with the rest of the timeline while
autoscrolling.</li>
<li>The automated codecs installer is (still) broken. See <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686182">bug
686182</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686181">GES
bug 686181</a>.</li>
<li>The automatic clip aligner feature does not work. We need someone to
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=708401">port it to use our new audio waveforms processing
module</a>.</li>
<li>If xptv file support is important to you, we urgently need someone
to get involved in fixing/refactoring the xptv formatter module in
GES. If no interest is shown after a few releases, support for this
legacy file format may be dropped.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686182">No dialog to install missing codecs after discovering
clips</a>, and no
error gets raised in that case. This means that the clip will
“appear” to have imported correctly, but if you try inserting it
into the timeline you may get errors in the background or Pitivi's
UI may hang.</li>

<h2 id="bugs-fixed-and-even-more-features">Bugs fixed (and even more features)</h2>
<p>It is difficult to evaluate the amount of commits directly related to
Pitivi in GStreamer. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 50 bugs in GStreamer have been fixed by Mathieu Duponchelle
between January and September 2013:</li>
<li>At least <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?chfieldto=2013-09-30;query_format=advanced;chfieldfrom=2011-08-01;longdesc=pitivi;longdesc_type=allwordssubstr;product=GStreamer">96
bugs</a>
in GStreamer since <a href="releases/0-15.html">0.15</a> mention Pitivi</li>
</ul>
<p>In GStreamer Editing Services, the Pitivi team has made 975 commits in
preparation for this release.</p>
<p>In Pitivi:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;target_milestone=0.91&amp;product=pitivi">Hundreds of bug
reports</a>
were resolved</li>
<li>There were 1348 commits between 0.15.2 and 0.91.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since you're reading the release notes of an an alpha release, we
suspect you might be pretty geeky, so here are roughly 150 (of the 1300+
commits) that are “interesting” but were not necessarily big enough to
be mentioned in the “top features” above.</p>
