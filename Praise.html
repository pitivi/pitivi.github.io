<p>“Here's the thing. I have found a legitimate video editor for Linux,
that is more powerful than Lightworks, that uses the latest GTK
technologies, and it's available to run right now with one download,
no proprietary counter. It's Pitivi. They just had a brand new
version, 0.95, and it's a huge, huge deal. I'm not joking, this is a
really big deal. [...] They've been essentially working on this
release for over a year, and they have done SO. MUCH. WORK. It's
almost an entirely new product. They've redone everything. [...]
This looks like an actual video editor! [...] If you're familiar
with Final Cut this is going to be a familiar editing experience for
you. [...] This is a whole new deal. I'm excited.”</p>

<p>“Pitivi es uno de los mejores editores de vídeo para Linux que he se

<p>“It is a testimony to Pitivi's stability that the only problems I
found with it were minor. (...) Obviously the big plus is the vast
assortment of effects available, and how easy they are to configure
and use. But the collective effect of the UI improvements (settings
presets, detachable tabs) and other enhancements (fully adjustable
frame rates, media previews) make for a better editing experience as
well.”</p>

<p>“What impresses me about Pitivi isn't so much that it's a flexible
multimedia editor — we have a handful of those already in the Linux
community. What I think sets Pitivi apart is that it makes video
editing intuitive. I don't generally create or edit video files, but I
was able to jump right in with this application. I didn't have any
need for a manual or tutorial (...). Pitivi has an interface which
allows people to learn by doing without a bunch of scary options or
jargon. Almost everything is drag-n-drop with this editor and I feel
it lowers the bar for people interested in putting together their own
videos.”</p>

<p>“(...) I have to say the work Thibault and the Pitivi guys have done
is incredible. Truly. (...) The wide selection of effects and the ease
in which they can be added/used is so simple and user-intuitive it
can’t help but stoke your creative fire. (...) The process for
editing/adjusting clip effects in Pitivi certainly scores one up here.
Where OpenShot hides effect preferences behind right-clicks and extra
windows Pitivi puts them slapbang where you can see and access them
equalling a usability plus. All of this is done in real-time, too: As
soon as you drag an effect on a clip it’s instantly applied. This
makes workflow irrepressibly speedy; you can see what works and what
doesn’t straight away. (...) I am utterly, utterly astounded by the
quality, handling &amp; fantastic interface this has gained in such a
short amount of time. It is a absolute credit to the talents of the
team behind this – and it’s not even released yet!”</p>

<p>“Overall, Pitivi is a promising application. It's a decent video
editor with no frills, and intuitive to pick up. And in the tests I
ran, Pitivi was rock-solid. This isn't something to be taken for
granted. Years ago I spent time editing video with Kino for various
projects, and learned to save after nearly every edit or operation.”</p>

<p>“I shuddered at the thought of editing on Linux, as every piece of
software I'd tried was extremely buggy and always crashed at some
point in the process. After seeing a comment in this subreddit, I
decided to give Pitivi a chance, and I was blown away. It is not the
most feature-packed editor (kdenlive), but it did exactly what I
needed it to do: I imported video, made cuts, added transitions, added
titles, and rendered out a 30min video to ProRes. Not a single glitch
in the whole process. Also, it looks great! If any Pitivi developers
are reading, THANK YOU! You have made a functional video editor under
Linux. Looking forward to your 1.0 release.”</p>

installation via flapak is simple and it works. Pitivi 0.96 is a great
release. It's stable, responsive, and it works. Kudos to the Pitivi
developers and wider community. [...] if you're like me, and you've
been waiting on the sidelines for a simple, stable video editor for
Linux (and in particular the GNOME/GTK environment) then I recommend
you give Pitivi 0.96 a try.”</p>

<p>(...) "I have worked as video editor in my earlier life (before I
became software programmer), and used Final Cut Pro. I have always
been a Linux user though, and have meddled with everything that exist
every single year. Cinelerra was always the fall-back that would never
really let me down because it was frank about its crashers and they
were possible to navigate around.</p>
<p>In later years, I did find Pitivi to be a possible replacement for
simple out-to-blog cuts. Especially the version before they added
filters. Sadly, the filters-version exposed lots of bugs in the
underlying stack and everything became dog-slow and probably quite
unstable. I just stuck with that old (now very old) version.</p>
<p>However, the new GES-backed 0.9-line that is aiming at becoming 1.0 is
something totally different. It is really shaping up to becoming a
quite awesome little video editor and I will be donating happily."

<strong>P Fudd</strong>: Thanks again for a great program! I managed to edit my
file correctly in the first 5 minutes of using Pitivi, which is far
faster than I managed with any other program! (2014 03 14 on
bug 719651)</li>
<li>
<strong>Jonathan Duff</strong>: I just want to say also I was blown away by how
intuitive, versatile (by using GStreamer), and powerful this program
is. I'm used to using Adobe Premiere Pro, so I was very impressed
when I found this gem. (2010 12 31 at 21h55 UTC)</li>
<li>
<strong>rowinggolfer</strong>: Loving the git version. You guys are awesome. I
was a Pitivi skeptic until a couple of weeks ago, but I am using it
daily to get stuff done with very few issues and a tiny learning
curve (2010 02 21 at 13h15 GMT -5)</li>

<li>“Great little application for quick video editing”:<br>
If you want to do some quick and simple video editing and exporting
then this is a great app for that. Do not expect it to do the world.

<li>“Must Have Video Editor!”:<br>
Gotta be one of the best I've used! It's definitely gotten WORLDS
better than it used to be. (Yanike, 2011-12-14)</li>
<li>“My Favorite Video Editor on Ubuntu”:<br>
I know that OpenShot seems to get a lot more attention as a video
editor on Ubuntu, but I find Pitivi to be the better software. For
example, I find making the actual cuts, more instinctual on Pitivi,
and I'm able to be more precise - It earns a lot of points for that.
[...] if you really want to do some efficient editing, I say go
with Pitivi. It gets my vote. (DigitalMan, 2011-11-27)</li>
<li>“Better than Ever”:<br>
What else can I say? UI is good, effects are nice and it handles big
files (2 GB) without crashing. It took a while, but now Pitivi is
finally usable editor with potential! (PYHhfWp, 2011-10-31)</li>
<li>“Getting there”:<br>
It has taken a while, but as of version 0.15.0, Pitivi is both
stable for me and presents a sufficient featureset to be useful.
Compared to other video editors, I find the UI a pleasure to use.
However, it's about time the still missing features (titling and
more complex transitions) are implemented. (Alexander Hunziker,

<strong>Wrinkliez</strong> first time trying anything video-editing-related. what
im finding is that Pitivi is really all I need— and that kdenlive is
buffy as fuck (2:08 PM Apr 17th via API)</li>

<strong>BranchPlan</strong> Just did small experiment with #Pitivi in #ubuntu
lucid. Replaced audio of video with song (example content). Worked
well and v. easy. (1:46 PM Mar 30th via identica)</li>

<strong>tristan_2468</strong> The new Pitivi video editing software in #Ubuntu
is seriously impressive. (11:08 AM Mar 29th via Gwibber)</li>

<strong>zootm</strong> @rubzo I found Pitivi (out some name similar too that)
surprisingly decent. I didn't have huge requirements though. (7:54

<strong>castrojo</strong> @bilboed - Took some video this weekend with my Nexus,

<strong>lucasratmundo</strong> Pitivi 0.13.4 is a really nice release. I only
miss some basic transitions and video adjustments (brightness,
saturation, contrast, etc). (6:05 PM Mar 21st via web)</li>

<strong>monsterjavaguns</strong> Played a bit with Pitivi - I'm actually pretty
impressed. Thought that project had been abandoned. Still doesn't do
everything I need, tho (2:55 PM Mar 11th via web)</li>

<strong>acruiz</strong> I'm finally managing to put together my first screencast
with #Pitivi and #gtk-recordmydesktop! (12:14 PM Feb 20th from

<strong>tueqtle009</strong> Just compiled a video with Pitivi. Unlike Movie
Maker, it allows the user to choose the output format. I prefer
Theora to WMV. (8:51 AM Feb 19th from Echofon)</li>

<strong>inorman88</strong> OH MY GAWD! I found a video making program that will
handle <a href="http://vimeo.com/9460793">5D Mark II 1080p video</a> out of the
box. And it's open source for linux. Pitivi (8:05 PM Feb 14th from

<strong>bercolax</strong> Pitivi rocks in editing screencasts... Tried it in
Ubuntu <a href="http://www.pitivi.org/">http://www.pitivi.org/</a> (9:49 PM Feb 5th from web)</li>

<strong>yibble</strong> Having some fun with Pitivi... Finally, simple video
editing for GNU/Linux that doesn't require any actual pro' courses
before using. (2:12 PM Jan 25th from HootSuite)</li>

<strong>ColinMacD</strong> Wow, I just edited a video on linux and it wasn't a
complete nightmare. Easy and a joy infact! #Pitivi is amazing!

<strong>zylogz80</strong> #Pitivi is soooo cool! Like iMove for Linux. Very
impressed! (5:46 PM Dec 31st, 2009 from web)</li>

<strong>F1LT3R</strong> Just discovered Pitivi the .ogg video editor for Gnome.
“It just works!” And it just works very well. <a href="http://bit.ly/rNzxM">http://bit.ly/rNzxM</a>

<strong>rysiekpl</strong> Pitivi and UbuntuStudio are absolutely, positively,
*awesome*! plus VLC and you get a full-blown video production and
streaming solution! :) (4:13 PM Nov 28th, 2009 from identica)</li>

<strong>EugeniaLoli</strong> What does my mother, Pitivi, Kodak and Linux have in
common? Find out

<strong>pantoniades</strong> needed a simple &amp; easy video editing tool, and
#Pitivi was perfect for the job. (9:44 AM Aug 14th, 2009 from

<strong>herrsteiner</strong> #Pitivi helped me to convert a video to #ogg
#theora which I strangly couldn't convert on commandline without
loosing the audio (7:31 PM Aug 13th, 2009 from web)</li>
