        <p>These QA Scenarios are here to check the expected behaviours of Pitivi
under many situations.</p>
<p>If you see a problem in one of them, <a href="Bug_reporting.html">create an issue</a>
on GitLab, indicating:</p>
<ul>
<li>which QA Scenario doesn't go through,</li>
<li>(optionally) the media files you used,</li>
<li>At which step it failed and what happened</li>
<li>Which version of Pitivi was used</li>
</ul>
